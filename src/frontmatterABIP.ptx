        <p>This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in introductory algebra-based physics. </p>

        <p>The purpose of creating this book is to make better use of the technology that electronic texts allow for without losing the
        functionality of a print book.  While this text should be comparable to any other print text, when this is provided in the online
        format it will provide links back and forth between early and later topics.  Linking from later material to earlier material will
        allow students to refresh their memory of what was previously discussed.  Linking from earlier material to later material will
        inspire students to look ahead to how that topic will be used in more interesting scenarios. </p>

        <p>Having these links will allow for some other interesting features that can be placed in the back of the book and accessed
        through links.  Examples of this might be:
        <ol>
            <li><p> <q>Dig Deeper</q> where some of the more tedious and some of the more interesting aspects can be investigated. For
            example in <xref ref="c-motion"  /> on the equations of motion, one might see how these equations are direct applications of calculus
            for those students who happen to have taken that course (which is common for biology and pre-medical students). </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Every Equation Tells a Story</q> which discusses how the description-in-English and the description-with-math
            interrelate to build intuition in both directions. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Examples</q>, with the difference from a traditional textbook being that students can interact with the example as:
            <q>If you have this question, then go here. If you have that question, then go there.</q> </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>In the <lsq/>Real World<rsq/></q> where students see how the concept lives in the messy real world and why
            physicists simplify or ignore complicating aspects.
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Explorations ask the reader to imagine a situation that describes the real world and possibly make choices that result in different consequences.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Investigations ask the reader to do (or think about doing) specific actions that need to be done outside or might in some way be accessible to some people, like riding a merry-go-round, driving
                    a car, or rearranging large pieces of furniture.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Activities ask the reader to do small table-top scale activities that could be considered mini-lab exercises and have a more specific procedure associated with them.</p></li>
                </ol></p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Connections</q>, which might take one of three forms:
            <ol>
                <li><p> <em>Looking Back</em> which links back to earlier material to address the question <q>Where have I seen this before?</q></p></li>

                <li><p> <em>Looking Ahead</em> which links ahead to later material to address the question <q>When will I ever use this?</q> </p></li>

                <li><p> <em>In Detail</em> which links to popular or complex topics to address the question <q>Why is this interesting?</q> </p></li>
            </ol></p></li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <todo>storyboard the characters and how they develop</todo>
        <p>The goal of the book is to encourage curiosity in the reader. Since there is an expectation that students will explore the
        material on their own, advanced topics will explicitly note where the reader can look for supporting material and basic topics will
        be motivated with links to more advanced topics.  To help maintain the interest of the reader, recurring characters will be
        featured in the examples.  These characters will live a storyline and
        interact with each other.  It is possible to read the examples as a separate storyline for the N interacting characters. </p>
        <todo>Decide how many characters</todo>

        <p>I am choosing the approach described above based on the assumption that students will prefer to develop their knowledge by
        building a world-view that connects to their current understanding, their interests, and their world-view. Providing the
        cross-referencing links without distracting students with all of the information at once will enable them to explore the
        information. Writing the text in a narrative style that helps students see the explanations for the world they live in will
        encourage them to explore <q>what happens when I do this</q> in their real life. Fostering this spirit of exploration will enable
        the instructors to bring their own active-learning techniques into the classroom. </p>

        <p>Some features that are not dissimilar to other textbooks:
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Warnings (should this be Cautions?) make the reader aware of possible misconceptions or inappropriate associations.  [This is the <q>don't do this</q> or <q>do this to prevent bad
                    consequences</q> in contrast to Insights.]</p></li>
                    <li><p>Insights make the reader aware of helpful associations.  [This is the <q>do this to enable positive consequences</q> in contrast to Warnings.] </p></li>
                    <li><p>Conventions specify how notation or terminology should be used. [This is the <q>that</q> to Clarification's <q>which</q>.]</p></li>
                    <li><p>Clarifications clarify how notation or terminology should be used. [This is the <q>which</q> to Convention's <q>that</q>.]</p></li>
                    <li><p>Observations help the reader to use observations about the world around them to better understand (give context to) the physics being discussed.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Interpretations help the reader use the physics being discussed to better understand their observations about the world around them.</p></li>
                </ol>
        </p>

        <todo>(em)Book Layout:(/em) Here we should add information about Adventures, Examples, Equation-Stories, and IRLs.</todo>
        <p>This textbook is in several Parts:  <em><xref ref="P-prerequisites"  text="type-global" /></em> is for the preliminaries, including descriptions of science in general, physics in
        particular, and the use of math.  <em><xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> is intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar.  <em><xref ref="P-UsingMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> develops the
        ideas in <xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /> by introducing momentum, circular motion, rotational motion, torque, and the Newtonian theory of gravitation.
        <em><xref ref="P-oscillations" text="global">Parts</xref> and <xref ref="P-thermodynamics" text="global"/></em>  are oscillations and thermodynamics.  With the traditional organization of the two-semester
        introductory physics, these parts can be covered in either order and can be chosen to be put in either semester. <em><xref ref="P-EandM"  text="type-global" /></em>
        covers electricity, magnetism, light, and optics.  This is traditionally the meat of the second semester. <em><xref ref="P-modern"  text="type-global" /></em>
        touches on the topics that are usually referred to as <q>modern physics</q>.  The goal with including these chapters is to provide
        some inspiration for what some students see as the tedium of the standard material.  These chapters will be linked to throughout
        the book as examples of how the traditional material supports the material that may be in the news and is more talked about in
        popular science.  The last final part, <em><xref ref="P-supplements"  text="type-global" /></em>, holds the answers to the interactive examples mentioned above, the bulk
        of the adventures the reader can investigate in order to test their understanding of the material, and the story lines of each of
        the characters in the text. </p>

            <p><alert>A note about viewing the PDF online:</alert>
            If you are viewing this as a PDF set to view <q>single page,</q> then the links will take you to the top of the relevant
            page, rather than to the specific topic.  If, on the other hand, you are viewing this in <q>continuous view</q> then you should
            go directly to the location of interest. If you are viewing this in <q>two-page</q> mode (whether continuous or not), it might
            not be immediately obvious to which page (left or right) you have jumped.  Most of the PDF viewers I have encountered allow you
            to follow links and to return to your previous location.  On most PCs, the way to return to your previous location is by
            holding the <c>ctrl</c> key and pressing the <m>[\leftarrow]</m> (<c>Left-Arrow</c>) button.  There are a few PDF viewers that do not
            allow you to <q>go back</q> to the location you linked from.  Whether or not you have that capability, I have placed <q>return
            links</q> in the margins so that you can get back to the place from which you linked. </p>
