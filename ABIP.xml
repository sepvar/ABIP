    <preface>

        <p>This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in introductory algebra-based physics. </p>
        
        <p>The purpose of creating this book is to make better use of the technology that electronic texts allow for without losing the 
        functionality of a print book.  While this text should be comparable to any other print text, when this is provided in the online 
        format it will provide links back and forth between early and later topics.  Linking from later material to earlier material will 
        allow students to refresh their memory of what was previously discussed.  Linking from earlier material to later material will 
        inspire students to look ahead to how that topic will be used in more interesting scenarios. </p> 

        <p>Having these links will allow for some other interesting features that can be placed in the back of the book and accessed 
        through links.  Examples of this might be: 
        <ol> 
            <li><p> <q>Dig Deeper</q> where some of the more tedious and some of the more interesting aspects can be investigated. For 
            example in \autoref{c:motion} on the equations of motion, one might see how these equations are direct applications of calculus 
            for those students who happen to have taken that course (which is common for biology and pre-medical students). </p></li> 
            
            <li><p> <q>Every Equation Tells a Story</q> which discusses how the description-in-English and the description-with-math 
            interrelate to build intuition in both directions. </p></li> 
            
            <li><p> <q>Examples</q>, with the difference from a traditional textbook being that students can interact with the example as: 
            <q>If you have this question, then go here. If you have that question, then go there.</q> </p></li> 
            
            <li><p> <q>In the <lsq/>Real World<rsq/></q> where students see how the concept lives in the messy real world and why 
            physicists simplify or ignore complicating aspects. </p></li> 
            
            <li><p> <q>Connections</q>, which might take one of three forms:</p></li>
            <ol>
                <li><p> <q>Where have I seen this before?</q> (linking back to earlier material) </p></li> 
                
                <li><p> <q>When will I ever use this?</q> (linking ahead to later material) </p></li> 
                
                <li><p> <q>Why is this interesting?</q> (linking to popular or complex topics)</p></li> 
            </ol>
        </ol> 
        </p>
        
        <p>The goal of the book is to encourage curiosity in the reader. Since there is an expectation that students will explore the 
        material on their own, advanced topics will explicitly note where the reader can look for supporting material and basic topics will 
        be motivated with links to more advanced topics.  To help maintain the interest of the reader, recurring characters will be 
        featured in the examples.  These characters will live a storyline\dothis{storyboard the characters and how they develop}{} and 
        interact with each other.  It is possible to read the examples as a separate storyline for the N\urgent{Decide how many 
        characters}{} interacting characters. </p>

        <p>I am choosing the approach described above based on the assumption that students will prefer to develop their knowledge by 
        building a world-view that connects to their current understanding, their interests, and their world-view. Providing the 
        cross-referencing links without distracting students with all of the information at once will enable them to explore the 
        information. Writing the text in a narrative style that helps students see the explanations for the world they live in will 
        encourage them to explore <q>what happens when I do this</q> in their real life. Fostering this spirit of exploration will enable 
        the instructors to bring their own active-learning techniques into the classroom. </p>

        <p>This textbook is in several Parts\urgcap{book layout}{Here we should add information about Adventures, Examples, 
        Equation-Stories, and IRLs.}:  <em>Part I</em> is for the preliminaries, including descriptions of science in general, physics in 
        particular, and the use of math.  <em>Part II</em> is intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These 
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can 
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar.  <em>Part III</em> develops the 
        ideas in Part II by introducing momentum, circular motion, rotational motion, torque, and the Newtonian theory of gravitation.  
        <em>Parts IV</em> and <em>V</em> are oscillations and thermodynamics.  With the traditional organization of the two-semester 
        introductory physics, these parts can be covered in either order and can be chosen to be put in either semester. <em>Part VI</em> 
        covers electricity, magnetism, light, and optics.  This is traditionally the meat of the second semester. <em>Part VII</em> 
        touches on the topics that are usually referred to as <q>modern physics</q>.  The goal with including these chapters is to provide 
        some inspiration for what some students see as the tedium of the standard material.  These chapters will be linked to throughout 
        the book as examples of how the traditional material supports the material that may be in the news and is more talked about in 
        popular science.  The last final part, <em>Part VIII</em>, holds the answers to the interactive examples mentioned above, the bulk 
        of the adventures the reader can investigate in order to test their understanding of the material, and the story lines of each of 
        the characters in the text. </p>

        <aside><title>A note about viewing the PDF online:</title> 
            <p>If you are viewing this as a PDF set to view <q>single page,</q> then the links will take you to the top of the relevant 
            page, rather than to the specific topic.  If, on the other hand, you are viewing this in <q>continuous view</q> then you should 
            go directly to the location of interest. If you are viewing this in <q>two-page</q> mode (whether continuous or not), it might 
            not be immediately obvious to which page (left or right) you have jumped.  Most of the PDF viewers I have encountered allow you 
            to follow links and to return to your previous location.  On most PCs, the way to return to your previous location is by 
            holding the <c>[ctrl]</c> key and pressing the <c><m>[\leftarrow]</m></c> button.  There are a few PDF viewers that do not 
            allow you to <q>go back</q> to the location you linked from.  Whether or not you have that capability, I have placed <q>return 
            links</q> in the margins so that you can get back to the place from which you linked. </p>
