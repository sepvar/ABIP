        <p>This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in introductory algebra-based physics. </p>

        <p>The purpose of creating this book is to make better use of the technology that electronic texts allow for without losing the
        functionality of a print book.  While this text should be comparable to any other print text, when this is provided in the online
        format it will provide links back and forth between early and later topics.  Linking from later material to earlier material will
        allow students to refresh their memory of what was previously discussed.  Linking from earlier material to later material will
        inspire students to look ahead to how that topic will be used in more interesting scenarios. </p>

        <p>Having these links will allow for some other interesting features that can be placed in the back of the book and accessed
        through links.  Examples of this might be:
        <ol>
            <li><p> <q>Dig Deeper</q> where some of the more tedious and some of the more interesting aspects can be investigated. For
            example in <xref ref="c-motion"  /> on the equations of motion, one might see how these equations are direct applications of calculus
            for those students who happen to have taken that course (which is common for biology and pre-medical students). </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Every Equation Tells a Story</q> which discusses how the description-in-English and the description-with-math
            interrelate to build intuition in both directions. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Examples</q>, with the difference from a traditional textbook being that students can interact with the example as:
            <q>If you have this question, then go here. If you have that question, then go there.</q> </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>In the <lsq/>Real World<rsq/></q> where students see how the concept lives in the messy real world and why
            physicists simplify or ignore complicating aspects. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Connections</q>, which might take one of three forms:
            <ol>
                <li><p> <em>Looking Back</em> which links back to earlier material to address the question <q>Where have I seen this before?</q></p></li>

                <li><p> <em>Looking Ahead</em> which links ahead to later material to address the question <q>When will I ever use this?</q> </p></li>

                <li><p> <em>In Detail</em> which links to popular or complex topics to address the question <q>Why is this interesting?</q> </p></li>
            </ol></p></li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <todo>storyboard the characters and how they develop</todo>
        <p>The goal of the book is to encourage curiosity in the reader. Since there is an expectation that students will explore the
        material on their own, advanced topics will explicitly note where the reader can look for supporting material and basic topics will
        be motivated with links to more advanced topics.  To help maintain the interest of the reader, recurring characters will be
        featured in the examples.  These characters will live a storyline and
        interact with each other.  It is possible to read the examples as a separate storyline for the N interacting characters. </p>
        <todo>Decide how many characters</todo>

        <p>I am choosing the approach described above based on the assumption that students will prefer to develop their knowledge by
        building a world-view that connects to their current understanding, their interests, and their world-view. Providing the
        cross-referencing links without distracting students with all of the information at once will enable them to explore the
        information. Writing the text in a narrative style that helps students see the explanations for the world they live in will
        encourage them to explore <q>what happens when I do this</q> in their real life. Fostering this spirit of exploration will enable
        the instructors to bring their own active-learning techniques into the classroom. </p>

        <todo>(em)Book Layout:(/em) Here we should add information about Adventures, Examples, Equation-Stories, and IRLs.</todo>
        <p>This textbook is in several Parts:  <em><xref ref="P-prerequisites"  text="type-global" /></em> is for the preliminaries, including descriptions of science in general, physics in
        particular, and the use of math.  <em><xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> is intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar.  <em><xref ref="P-UsingMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> develops the
        ideas in <xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /> by introducing momentum, circular motion, rotational motion, torque, and the Newtonian theory of gravitation.
        <em><xref ref="P-oscillations" text="global">Parts</xref> and <xref ref="P-thermodynamics" text="global"/></em>  are oscillations and thermodynamics.  With the traditional organization of the two-semester
        introductory physics, these parts can be covered in either order and can be chosen to be put in either semester. <em><xref ref="P-EandM"  text="type-global" /></em>
        covers electricity, magnetism, light, and optics.  This is traditionally the meat of the second semester. <em><xref ref="P-modern"  text="type-global" /></em>
        touches on the topics that are usually referred to as <q>modern physics</q>.  The goal with including these chapters is to provide
        some inspiration for what some students see as the tedium of the standard material.  These chapters will be linked to throughout
        the book as examples of how the traditional material supports the material that may be in the news and is more talked about in
        popular science.  The last final part, <em><xref ref="P-supplements"  text="type-global" /></em>, holds the answers to the interactive examples mentioned above, the bulk
        of the adventures the reader can investigate in order to test their understanding of the material, and the story lines of each of
        the characters in the text. </p>

        <introduction>
        <p>Once upon a time somebody saw the world around them and thought something equivalent to <q>well, that's an interesting pattern<ellipsis /></q> and predictions were born.  Every human and many animals build their own world of expectations such as: objects will fall down, food will arrive at mealtime, or certain people will smile at me.  Scientists study the patterns in the world around us and do so in a fairly specific way.  Novelists, sociologists, historians, and cartoonists also look at the world around us in a very particular way.  The story of humanity is a story about observing the world around us.</p>

        <p>Scientists, in general, observe patterns through careful, detailed measurements <ellipsis /></p>
        <todo>Add description of science.</todo>

        <p>Physicists, in particular, consider the patterns in the physical world around us.</p>
        <todo>Add description of physics</todo>

        <p xml:id="d-physicspatterns">Some patterns that you might experience help us take very different experiences and group them together.  For example, there are ways in which <xref ref="d-freefall" text="title">dropping your keys</xref> and <xref ref="d-ballistic" text="title">throwing a dog toy</xref> are very similar.  They both fall, even thought the fall along rather different paths.  There are also patterns that you experience that might look very similar but can be treated very differently.  For example, the path of baseball pitch (See <xref ref="irl-nonparabolic"  text="type-global" />.) is very different for a fast ball compared to a slider, a curve ball, or a knuckleball.</p>

        <introduction>
        <todo>This chapter should mirror (xref ref="c-revisted"  text="type-global" /)</todo>
        <p>What you will find in this book is a series of chapters that, on the surface, feel like a list of isolated topics.  Each chapter will have examples that focus your attention on examples of that specific concept.  However, the really interesting aspect of physics is that these descriptions of the world around us come together in different ways to explain complex systems that might feel unrelated.  For example, the thermodynamics of making your refrigerator work on Earth comes from the same theories of thermodynamics that help us understand the heat flow of the sun.  Furthermore, in order to understand the sun, we also need to understand the gravitational interaction, which also describes how baseballs fly through the air.</p>

        <p>This chapter will introduce a set of quick-overview explanations of phenomena to indicate how different ideas tie together in some complex systems.  The point  is specifically to over-simplify complex ideas in order to <q>get the idea</q>.  You will also be pointed to the various chapters that go into the details of the relevant physics where you can learn more.  Then, at the end of the book in <xref ref="c-revisted"  text="type-global" />, we will revisit each of these ideas and go into the description in more depth assuming you have understood each of the relevant chapters, with reference back to the sections that provide the basis of our understanding.</p>

                <warning> <p>Since this particular chapter is intended to be background introduction, rather than a place to study details, none of the links to other sections here will have return links in the rest of the text.  So, if you intend to use this as a jumping off point, you might want to create a bookmark here so that you can return after you read the details in other sections.</p></warning>

                <p>In the early ages of the universe, which is an entirely different story that could be told, there were a ridiculously large number of particles created and drifting around.  There were a variety of types (<xref ref="ss-StandardModel"  text="type-global" />), some being positively charged (<xref ref="s-Echarge"  text="type-global" />), some negatively charged, and some were neutral; but the larger ones tended to gradually decay (<xref ref="ss-particledecay"  text="type-global" />) into smaller ones.  The smaller of the positively-charged baryons (<xref ref="s-particle"  text="type-global" />), which we call protons, and the smallest of the negatively-charged leptons (<xref ref="s-particle"  text="type-global" />), which we call electrons, also tended to stick together because of their electrical charges (<xref ref="s-Echarge"  text="type-global" />), forming hydrogen atoms.  You may note that as this happens, sometimes the more ambitious of the particles form larger clumps of two protons and two neutrons, making helium atoms that are held together by the strong nuclear force ([need ref])</p>

                        <p>The bright, shiny sun, which keeps us all alive, is a nice example of a rather complex system that allows us to verify our various theories of the world around us.

        <p>All of our explanations are approximations.  This section will describe some physics in the world around us in one or two paragraphs with links to the sections in the book that provide the detailed understanding of that piece which connects to the mathematics and the underlying foundation.  Each topic will also link to a more detailed discussion at the end of the book with a longer conversation that gets into more nitty-gritty details which assume you have learned the details from the book.  In short, this section looks forward to what is possible to understand and that chapter looks back at how you do understand.  Each of these topics will also be accompanied by a five-minute podcast describing the topic.</p>

        <p>The term <term>effective theory</term> is used in physics to describe a wide-reaching phenomenon which can be approximated by a simpler theory in a smaller circumstance.  So, for example, Einstein's theory of general relativity as a complex description of the gravitational interaction.  It would be unwieldy and impractical to use that to describe our day-to-day interactions with the gravitational interaction.  On the other hand, Newton's theory of the gravitational interaction is a special case of Einstein's general theory of relativity that works perfectly well so long as you behave yourself and do not try to travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light.  We can say that Newton's theory of gravity is an effective theory for Einstein's theory of gravity that accounts for acceleration at low speeds.  Likewise, Einstein's special theory of relativity is an effective theory of the general theory of relativity.  The special theory is relevant when you do not allow for acceleration, but do allow for faster speeds.  Once you reach beyond the limitations of the effective theory, the description <q>breaks down</q>.</p>

        <p>For example, see the discussion around <xref ref="convention-g-value" text="type-global" /> regarding the acceleration due to gravity being <q>locally constant</q>.</p>

        <introduction>
        <p>Mathematics is its own language.  It is the language of patterns.  Humans are very adept at tracking patterns.  Physics is the study of patterns in the physical world.  It turns out that the language of physics provides a natural and concise mechanism for expressing patterns in a uniquely precise manner.</p>

        <p>Equations allow us to connect physical reality to very specific predictions.  For example, the equation for thermal conductivity, <xref ref="eq-thermalconductivity"  text="type-global">Equation</xref> in <xref ref="ss-thermalconductivity"  text="type-global" />, allows \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> to predict the time it takes for \hisA\ oven to warm up to a specific temperature because <m>\displaystyle \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \kappa A \, \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}</m> says that {the rate at which energy flows} {depends on} {how well air allows energy to flow,} {the size of the oven,} and {the amount the temperature needs to change} {across the height of the oven} as follows:</p>

                        <p>In order to understand how big something is, we need to know what scale we are using.  For example, Your thumb is about an inch across, but your foot is about a foot long.

                        For the second line, you need to convert the units:

                        because we need to be speaking about the same thing.  You have all had the experience of a miscommunication when you thought you were speaking about the same thing, but later found out you each meant something different.

                        <warning><title>Clarify your intent</title><p>You should always include every unit on every number throughout your entire math solution.  This will help you ensure that the units are self-consistent and will occasionally help you either recognize which algebraic step to take next or even which equation to use in the first place.</p></warning>
                        <p>After introducing some of the essential metric units here, we will build some intuition by considering how to convert from your likely more familiar English units in <xref ref="ss-convertunits" text="type-local" /> and then build these fundamental units into the broader derived units that help express the relationships between interesting quantities in <xref ref="ss-units" text="type-local" />.</p>

        <!-- \new{v2.2}{Added section, added some detail} -->

        <p>In this section, we will consider the benefits of being precise both in measurements and in our language.  Sometimes people confuse the words precise and accurate, but they mean different things.  It may help to remember that the opposite of precise is vague.  Being precise makes it easier to determine if a statement is accurate.  If we already know the answer, then we can know if a result is accurate.  However, the exciting aspect of science is to study that which we do not already know.  In this case, gauging accuracy can be tricky.  If we are do not already know an answer, then we can try to be consistent within our accepted precision.</p>

        <p>Since physics has its roots in the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks and developed mathematically with Galileo and Newton, it has been around long enough for the technical language to both evolve (Newton used the word <q>action</q> for what we refer to as <q>force</q>) and to be absorbed into everyday (colloquial) language. Words like force and energy have taken on broader meanings in English.  In this text, we will try to be precise with the language.  Hopefully we can avoid using the dismissive phrase, <q>Oh, you <em>know</em> what I <em>mean</em>.</q></p>

        <p xml:id="p-massive">One example of not being careful with the language comes when people use the term <q>massive</q> to mean <q>big.</q>  The word massive actually means <q>has a large amount of material</q> whereas big means <q>takes up a large amount of space</q> (which might be replaced by the word <q>voluminous</q> rather than <q>massive</q>). These are related by <xref ref="s-density" text="title">the density</xref><idx>density</idx> but it is possible to be massive and not voluminous (see, for example, the discussion of <xref ref="sss-blackhole2" text="title">black holes</xref>).  While it is <em>technically</em> inaccurate to use massive to mean big, <q>we</q> know what <q>we</q> mean.</p>

        <p>Life is complicated.  One mechanism that scientists in general and physicists in particular use to simplify their descriptions of the world around us is to build an effective theory.  These are not intended to be true (accurate) to as many decimal places as can be calculated, but rather are intended to be good enough.  In this context, good enough is most likely to mean something like: true to a reasonable number of decimal places.</p>

        <p>A colloquial example of this is when you wear a smile to give the impression of happiness even if you are not in the mood.  Most of your casual interactions will be the same as when you are in a good mood, but your friends who know you better will recognize the small discrepancies.</p>

        <p>A technical example of this is that Newton's theory of gravity is very precise as long as none of the objects being described are travelling <q>close</q> to the speed of light.  How close counts as close depends on the level of precision the measurement needs to be.  If any of the objects are moving close to the speed of light, then we need Einstein's general theory of relativity.  One way to describe this is that Newton's theory is a special case of Einstein's Theory.  Another way is describe it is that Newton's theory is an effective theory for Einstein's theory, effective when the speed is low.  It is possible for us to measure the difference between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory, but it is often not worth the effort of using the more complex theory in the cases where the simpler one will do; it is effectively true (rather than actually true).</p>

        <p>Another technical example is that Einstein's special theory of relativity is a special case of the general theory of relativity.  The aspect that makes it a special case is that the special theory only considers motion without acceleration.</p>

        <p>One final case that should be mentioned up front is to notice that humans experience the Earth <em>as if</em> it were stationary.</p>
        <todo>Decide if this should be filled out more or if it should reference the variety of places where the text fills out these kinds of details.</todo>

        <p>Sometimes we imagine objects to be <q>massless</q> or <q>frictionless</q>.  In these instances we <em>usually</em> mean that the mass (or amount of friction) is small enough to not impact the significant digits of our calculation.  In those cases, if we consider a more-precise measurement/computation, then the mass (or amount of friction) would impact the significant digits.  (See comments in <xref ref="ex-atwood-tension" text="type-global" />.)</p>

        <p>I should define a term <term>mostly true</term> that is used in concert with <term>effective theory</term> to indicate the topic has some caveats.  Then maybe list those in the <term>Touchstone</term> margin note?  See, for example, <xref ref="ts-friction" text="title">the Touchstone on friction</xref>.</p>

<part xml:id="P-IntroMFE"><title>Introducing Motion, Force, and Energy</title>
        <introduction>
        <p>The chapters in this Part are intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar. </p>

        <p>The trio of topics in this part of the book are fundamental and powerful concepts<fn xml:id="f-FPC">The idea of Fundamental and Powerful Concepts (F<ampersand />PC) is taken from Dr. Gerald Nosich, <em>Learning to Think Things Through</em>, Prentice Hall, 2012.</fn>.  These are fundamental in that most other topics in physics are built upon them.  They are powerful in that if they are well-understood, then one is empowered to use them to understand and develop an intuition for nearly any other topic that is experienced.  It has been my experience that with these topics, students can jump into a surprisingly wide variety of other, significantly more esoteric, topics and develop a reasonable grasp of the key concepts.  Furthermore, the development of understanding of these ideas introduce the language and thought processes of being a professional physicist such that it nicely bridges the language barrier that might otherwise exist due to the jargon of physics.</p>

                        <p xml:id="d-freefall">Since acceleration is the change in velocity (magnitude and/or direction), it is possible to select your own rate of change while driving your car.  However, that acceleration is difficult to measure directly.  Your speedometer measures the speed and you have to compute your acceleration based on how quickly your speed changes.  It turns out that there is a convenient way to start from the acceleration and compute the expected velocity:  Drop a ball or your keys.  To convince yourself that objects do, in fact, accelerate when they fall, we can consider dropping items.  One of the complications during such an experiment will be discussed in <xref ref="ss-airresistance" text="type-global" />.  If we drop a sheet of paper, air resistance causes an obvious effect (fluttering).  For this section, I will assume that the mass-to-surface-area ratio is large enough that we can <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effectively</xref> ignore the air resistance.</p>

If you have something somewhat cylindrical, like a wine bottle (!) or a pencil that is falling more quickly than something else, like a hammer, then try dropping the cylindrical object in different orientations to see if that affects the air resistance.

                <p>It turns out that, ignoring the effect of <xref ref="ss-airresistance" text="title">air resistance</xref>, all objects fall with the same acceleration (due to the gravity).  As discussed in <xref ref="ss-local-mg" text="type-global" />, this varies slightly round the world, but only slightly.  (See <xref ref="t-gworld" text="type-global" /> for some representative samples.)</p>

                                        Notice that these have some variation due to the rounding.  It turns out that the variation in the value of acceleration depends on the composition of the earth in your location as well as your altitude above sea-level.  That will be discussed in detail in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global" />, for simplicity we will assume (by <xref ref="convention-g-value" text="type-hybrid" />) that all objects accelerate at the rate of <m>9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m> when they are solely under the influence of gravity.</p>

                        <p xml:id="p-multistep">In physics we like to consider the simplest case that describes the relevant situation; however, these are often embedded in a more complicated situation and it is not always obvious to the <xref ref="d-casual" text="title">casual observer</xref>.  For example, if I throw a ball into the air, such as in <xref ref="ex-ceiling" text="type-local" />, then we need to consider the motion of the throw separately from the motion of the ball moving through the air and separately from the motion of catching the ball.  The general rule is that whenever the acceleration changes, we have to consider the motion separately.  We will learn later (<xref ref="ss-NII" text="type-global" />) that forces are related to acceleration, so for now, whenever you notice that different forces are acting on an object, then you should expect the acceleration to be different and, therefore, you should expect to break the problem into steps <em>during which</em> the forces (and acceleration) are constant and <em>between which</em> the forces (and acceleration) may change.</p>

It turns out that the air resistance is fairly complicated, but in the case of baseballs, the part that is relevant is that air resistance is strong when the ball is moving faster and weak when the ball is moving slower.  (This is different than the surface friction you will see in <xref ref="s-Ff" text="type-global"/>.)  The effect of this is that the ball (usually) looks like it travels up into the air on a fairly straight path with a slight bend, which would produce a very wide parabola.  As it slows, the horizontal motion decreases, which tightens the parabola.  By the time the ball gets to its highest point, it is often travelling fairly slowly and has mostly all vertical motion by the time it drops into the outfielder's glove.</p></solution>

As the ball rolls out of the pitcher's hand, a spin is (usually) given to the ball and this spin interacts with the air to modify the direction that the air presses on the ball during the flight.  This will slightly affect the flight of the ball during the time it takes for the ball to get from the pitcher's mound to home plate.  In addition, fast balls have less time for the gravitational force to pull the ball down, so they will curve downwards less than a slower pitch.  This makes following the path of the ball somewhat difficult, but with some practice and careful attention, you should be able to see it.  All balls will drop somewhat, but the effect of the air resistance is exactly the mechanism for making a pitch unpredictable, so it is unlikely that you see the ball drop in a clean parabolic path.</p></solution>

                        <p>By now you may have noticed that it is tedious to keep saying <q>pushed or pulled,</q> so we will only say <q>push</q> even when we are including the possibility of <q>pushing or pulling</q>.</p>

                <p>Sometimes we care about the thing doing the pushing or pulling, sometimes we don't.  We always care about the thing being pushed or pulled.  We will <em>distinguish these objects</em> by referring to the object that is pushing as the object <q>causing the force</q> or <q>exerting the force</q> and by referring to the object that is being pushed as the object <q>feeling the force</q>.  We will <em>distinguish these forces</em> as follows:</p>

                <convention xml:id="conv-on-by"><title>The <q>on-by</q> notation</title>
                <p>Let's imagine that \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> gives \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> a good-natured shove in the arm.  The following are useful descriptions and are different ways of describing the same action.

                </ul>
                The notation for this will be <m>F_{A,B}</m> where the first subscript is the person who felt the force (who the force is <q>on</q>) and the second subscript is who exerted the force (who the force is <q>by</q>).  In those instances when we only care about who is feeling the force and not who is exerting the force, we might just use one subscript <m>F_A</m>.  </p>
                <p>In some cases, there may be two forces acting on one person (or object).  In that case, it will be obvious who is feeling the force and we will use the subscript to distinguish which force it is <em>in addition to</em> who feels the force, such as <m>F_{A1}</m> and <m>F_{A2}</m>, or <em>rather than</em> who feels the force, such as <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m>.
                This will be more relevant when we discuss in <xref ref="c-forcetype" text="type-global"/> the types of forces that might be applied.  <xref ref="conv-on-by-type" text="type-global" /> will expand this notation.</p>

        Newton's Laws describe our observations about three questions:
        <ol>
                <li><p> What happens to an object when I <em>don't</em> push on it?</p></li>
                <li><p> What happens <em>to an object</em> when I do push on it?</p></li>
                <li><p> What happens <em>to me</em> when I push on an object?</p></li>
        </ol>
        The answers to these questions have precise, concise, technical language and the point of the next three subsections is to translate that into (modern) English, into math, and into intuition.  The statement of these laws has slightly different versions in different texts to emphasize different points.  We will state them as follows<idx><h>Newton</h><h>laws</h></idx><idx><h>laws</h><h>Newton</h></idx>:</p>
        <assemblage xml:id="as-Newton"><title>Newton's Laws</title>
        <p><ol>
                <li><p>When viewed from an inertial reference frame, an object with no forces acting on it will maintain its velocity, which may be zero.</p> <p>(Detailed in <xref ref="ss-NI" text="type-local" />.)</p></li>
                <li><p> When viewed from an inertial reference frame, the vector-sum of all forces acting on an object will cause that object to accelerate in proportion to its mass: <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m \vec a</m>.</p> <p>(Detailed in <xref ref="ss-NII" text="type-local" />.)</p></li>
                <li><p> For every force acting (the <q>action</q>) on one object by an other object, there is an equal-in-magnitude reaction-force acting on the other object in the opposite direction.</p> <p>(Detailed in <xref ref="ss-NIII" text="type-local" />.)</p></li>
        </ol></p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>There are a few terms that should be clarified in these laws.</p>
        <remark xml:id="d-NewtonInertial"><title>Inertial Reference Frame</title>
                <p>Being in an inertial <xref ref="def-referenceframe" text="title">reference frame</xref><idx><h>reference frames</h><h>inertial</h></idx> essentially means being in a place in which you do not have to hold on in order to maintain your position.</p>
                <p>If you are <xref ref="d-acc" text="title">accelerating</xref> then you are not in an inertial reference frame, but rather are in a non-inertial reference frame.  In this case, you will misinterpret the forces acting.  This will be discussed in more detail in <xref ref="s-noninertial" text="type-global" /> when we discuss the surface of the Earth as a non-inertial rotating reference frame.  The fact that the Earth spins will be relevant for global-sized systems, such as the atmosphere and the ocean (discussed in <xref ref="ss-coriolis" text="type-global" /> with the Coriolis effect).</p>
                <p>For human-sized interactions, the effect of the Earth spinning is small enough that for most of what we <xref ref="d-casual" text="title">casually observe</xref>, we can safely pretend that the Earth is stationary and that we are actually at rest while sitting on the curb watching the world go by.  This is so true that our human brains already interpret everything around us as though it were an inertial reference frame.  This psychological perspective is exactly the feature that both allows us to make fairly reliable predictions about the world around us <em>and</em> causes us to make incorrect judgements when we encounter human-sized non-inertial reference frames.  That is to say, as long as we don't measure our world too closely, we are viewing it from an essentially inertial reference frame.  This point is so implicit, that many books do not even include<fn xml:id="f-Newtoninclude">Newton himself did not include it in his original statement.</fn>
                the portion of the statement referring to the reference frame.</p>
                <todo>check the implications of this footnote.</todo>
        </remark>
                <biographical><title>Touchstone (mostly true)</title><p>Recall <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effective theories</xref>.  Standing on the surface of the Earth provides an essentially-inertial reference frame.</p></biographical>

        <remark xml:id="d-objectinmotion"><title>Objects in motion</title>
                <p>Sometimes Newton's first law is written<fn xml:id="fn-NI">A common statement of this is: An object in motion remains in motion and an object at rest remains at rest unless an external force is applied.  This <em>feels clumsy</em> and the statement used in this text is meant to emphasize that <q>in uniform motion</q> and <q>at rest</q> are both inertial-states.</fn> to include the phrase <q>an object in motion</q>, which I will be careful to link directly to <xref ref="d-motion" text="title">velocity</xref>, as was done above.  However, it technically should reference the momentum, which is discussed in <xref ref="c-momentum" text="type-global" />.</p>
        </remark>

        <remark xml:id="d-action-reaction"><title>Action / Reaction</title>
                <p>The way Newton's third law is often written<fn xml:id="fn-NIII">A common statement of this is: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  This leaves open some interpretation that tends to cause confusion among some students. The statement used in this text is meant to emphasize that the <q>action</q> and <q>reaction</q> are specifically forces and that the reaction-force is specifically not on the same object as the action-force.</fn> (and referred to) includes the words <q>action</q> and <q>reaction</q>.  Newton was referring to forces with these words and to keep it clear in our discussion, we will use the word force, with the occasional clarification of the action-force or the reaction-force.</p>

                <p>As indicated in <xref ref="d-NewtonInertial" text="type-global" />, it is usually safe to assume you are in an inertial reference frame for your daily experience.  So, at this point we won't worry about the words before the comma.</p>

                        <p>Forces are those things that cause a change in the velocity.</p>

                        <p>This law is often called the <q>law of inertia</q>.  The concept of inertia can be described as <em>the tendency of an object to maintain its velocity</em>.  This is describing how the object behaves when you don't do anything to it.  The inertia is not a quantity that physicists calculate, but physicists do refer to objects as having a lot of inertia, usually to indicate that it will take a large force to change the object's motion, or as having a small amount of inertia, usually to indicate that it should be relatively easy to change the object's motion.  However, the inertia does not actually refer to the force needed.  Instead, the inertia most often refers to the <q>inertial mass</q> of an object, which shows up in the second law.</p>
                                <insight><p>Inertia is not a force.</p></insight>
                        <p>Sometimes when physicists are not being careful with their language, they will appear to use the word inertia interchangeably with the term <xref ref="def-momentum" text="title">momentum</xref>, which we will discuss in more detail in <xref ref="ss-inertia" text="type-global" />.</p>

                        <p>You should notice that Newton's first law is about what happens when you are <em>not pushing</em> on the object, which is to say, the tendency of an object to maintain its own motion without a force acting on it; this is the inertia of the object.  On the other hand, Newton's second law is about what happens <em>to the object</em> when you <em>do push</em> on an it.  This is what we will consider next.  After that, Newton's third law will describe what happens <em>to the thing pushing</em> rather than just to the thing being pushed.
                        <xref ref="sss-NIItogether" text="phrase-global" /> will explore these ideas further.

                <p>For this law, it is often sufficient to write down the equation and know that the words are there for back-up.  While most people have no trouble remembering <m>F=ma</m>, it is important to pay attention to two aspects:

                        <p>This word can be traced back to Latin and Old English with the prefix <em>equi-</em> for <em>equal</em> and the root <em>libra</em> referring to a <em>pair of scales, as in a balance</em>, such as those depicted in images of the astronomical constellation Libra.  When the scales are equal, they are in equilibrium.  Since the second law asks us to calculate the sum of the forces acting on an object, one of the primary questions is to determine if those forces balance each other.  In <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="se-netFsub" text="type-global" />, the forces are not balanced, the object <q>is not in equilibrium</q>, and it will be accelerated in a particular direction.  In the <xref ref="se-equi" text="type-global" />, the forces are balanced, the object <q>is in equilibrium</q>, and it will <em>not change</em> its velocity (in accord with the first law).</p>

                        <p>When forces act on an object, Newton's second law applies, so we usually start with the second law.  If those forces combine to give a net force of zero, such that the object is in equilibrium, then Newton's first law applies.  If we also care about the person or thing pushing, then the third law also applies.</p>

                        <p>To better understand how the first and second laws work together, <xref ref="irl-NI" text="type-global" /> provides some activities that you can do or consider in order to think about the patterns you can see when you are or aren't pushing on objects.  <xref ref="cyoa-NI" text="type-global" /> will help you think through some of the consequences of the first and second law.  When you are ready to solve some problems, you can jump to <xref ref="s-NewtonExamples" text="type-global" />, but some of those examples will also reference Newton's third law.</p>

The engine parts have grease and oil, but still take a lot of energy to turn.  This causes friction, which dissipates energy and, more importantly, exerts a backwards force on the spinning wheels.

                        <p>In the more interesting situations where there are several forces acting, it can be easy to lose track of what is pushing whom where.  In order to better organize our information and direct our attention, we can make use of <term>free-body diagrams</term>.  The basic idea is to make a diagram for each individual object that we care about in a given situation, and <em>free</em> from the overall picture.  This allows us to identify the forces acting on a single object (relevant for Newton's second law) and more easily pair them with third-law pairs that act on different objects.</p>

                        <p>To see how this works, the next example will build on the previous examples to help us consider not only the (2nd law) forces on the object, but also the (3rd law) forces on the people doing the pushing and pulling.</p>

                                        As before, make this object a desk so that we can have \studentA\ and \studentB\ helping you rearrange your room in your residence hall.  (Change the mass!  But, it is still nice to be moving a small mass so that it has a large acc, and the people have small acc.)

                                <p>Let's reconsider <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="type-global" />
                                and imagine that \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> stands to the left of the object and exerts a force to the right (pushes) with magnitude <m>\vec F_1 = +5.0\unit{N}\ihat</m> and that \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> stands to the right of the object and exerts a force to the right (pulls) with magnitude <m>\vec F_2 = +4.0\unit{N}\ihat</m>, as drawn in <xref ref="f1-firstFBD" text="type-global" />.  Both of these forces are <em>on</em> the object and, by <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref> cause it to accelerate (as described in <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" />).  <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title">Newton's third law</xref> tells us about the interaction <em>between</em> objects and, from this, we can deduce the force on \studentA\ and \studentB.<fn>It is then separately possible to use <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">the second law</xref> to learn about the motion of the people, as will be shown in <xref ref="se-FBD-AB" text="type-global" />.</fn>

                        <p>As indicated above, the free-body diagram also helps us visualize the third-law (action/reaction) force pairs.  By evaluating the colored forces in <xref ref="f2-firstFBD" text="type-global" /><idx><h>free-body diagrams</h><h>images</h></idx>, we can see that the <m>\mathrm{\color{green}{green\ forces}}</m> form an action-reaction pair and separately the <m>\mathrm{\color{blue}{blue\ forces}}</m> form an action-reaction pair.

                          <li>The <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title">third law</xref> action-reaction pairs are located of different objects and cannot be added. (You cannot add blue to blue nor green to green.)</li>

                        None of these three are in equilibrium, because they each have a net force.   <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" /> calculates the acceleration of the object. <xref ref="se-FBD-AB" text="type-global" /> calculates the acceleration of the people.</p>

                                <p>In the same way that <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" /> was able to use <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref> to compute the acceleration of an object after <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="type-global" /> found the net force, we can use the forces found in <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> to compute the acceleration of the people pushing the box.
                                Recall that <xref ref="f1-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> shows how \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> and \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> exert forces on the box (and, from <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title">Newton's third law</xref>, how the box exerts force on the people).

                                It might be interesting to note that, since everybody and thing has a different mass, the accelerations are all different.  This would also be true if the forces were all the same.

                        <p xml:id="d-FBD-AB">The point of <xref first="f-firstFBD" last="se-FBD-AB" text="global">Examples</xref> in comparison to Examples <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="global" /> (which told us about the forces on the object) and <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="global" /> (which told us about how the object moved) is to highlight the different roles of Newton's second and third laws.  The earlier examples were relevant to the second law and only affected the object itself.  To say this more specifically, the forces within one free-body diagram are described by Newton's second law. They do get added together to form the net-force (which is to say that we can add the object's green force to the object's blue force). They are able to cancel each other if they <em>happen to</em> be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Finally, they will determine how that specific object accelerates.  On the other hand, Newton's third law describes any specific pair of forces that interact between free-body diagrams (each colored pair); they <em>will necessarily be</em> equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, but they cannot be canceled because they cannot be added because they are on different objects.</p>

                <answer xml:id="A-hbf"><p>There are forces acting on it.  You should be able to tell this because you are exerting one of the forces. While it is true that there are forces on it, it is also true that there is no <em>net force</em>.  If you are exerting an upward force on the book, can you guess (<xref ref="A-gravity" text="type-local" />) what the downward force is?   </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-hbnof"><p>It is true that while you hold the book, there is no <em>net force</em>, but that does not mean that there is no force acting.  If there were no forces on the book, then your hand would not need to be there.  In fact, if you remove the force your hand provides, then the book falls. This shows that there is an upward force (by your hand on the book) and a downward force (of gravity by the Earth on the book). </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-true1"><p>It is in equilibrium.  When the acceleration is zero, then the net force must be zero and those properties are what define equilibrium.</p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-false1"><p>The definition of equilibrium is that the forces balance.  The result of this is that the net force must be zero and the acceleration is then zero.  You can tell this is true because the velocity is <em>not changing</em>.  It is not important that the velocity is zero, what is important is that the velocity <em>stays</em> zero.  While you hold it, the book is in equilibrium. </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-falls"><p>Both <q>Yes</q> and <q>No</q> bring you to this answer.  Yes, there is <em>a force</em> on the book while it falls (the force of gravity), but no, there are not force<alert>s</alert> (plural).  There is only one force.  <q>But, wait!</q> you say, <q>What about the force of air resistance?</q>  Aha!   You are correct; there is a force of air resistance, but in this case, it is negligible and we will not consider it.

In either case, force causes a <em>change in</em> velocity. You are trying to speed the chair up and the floor is trying to slow the chair down.  (Both are trying to change the velocity, but cancel to result in a constant velocity.)

The reason is that this is <em>how all objects behave; they maintain their velocity when allowed to act without interference.</em> (This is why Newton's first law says what it does.)   Because the chair with wheels has much less friction there is a smaller force trying to interfere with the motion and so it continues to move for a noticeable distance. The other chairs slowed to a stop almost immediately.  The wheel-less chair on tile might have continued for a short distance if it was moving fast enough that it required a long enough time to change its velocity to zero. </p></solution>

The careful way to describe the situation is that your force gave the chair some velocity (actually <xref ref="c-momentum" text="title">momentum</xref>) and its characteristic inertia made it difficult for the <xref ref="s-Ff" text="title">frictional force</xref> to slow it down rapidly.</p></solution>

For the carpet, there is a lot of friction and the chair slows down very quickly (essentially instantaneously).  For the wheel-less chair on the tile floor, the chair slows rapidly although it may leave your hand.  The wheels provide the least amount of friction and that chair goes the furthest.  You may note that the friction slowing the chair-with-wheels is primarily between the rolling wheel and its axel (where it connects to the non-rolling chair leg) rather than between the wheel and the floor (although the friction between the wheel and the floor also plays a role).

On the other hand, if you did continue to push, then the chair would continue to speed up and you would have to run faster and faster to keep up with it. On the other hand, if the chair were not experiencing friction, then you probably wouldn't either and you couldn't get enough traction to keep up with the chair, so it would sail away almost immediately, being then described by Newton's first law!</p></solution>

                <p>Notice in each case that you are not the only thing interacting with the chair.  The floor is also interacting with the chair.  The floor exerts a <xref ref="s-Ff" text="title">force of friction</xref> on the chair.  So, when you interpret how your force causes the chair to move, you <em>must</em> also account for the interaction with the floor in your expectations.  We can minimize the effect of friction, by modifying the floor surface.  If you have ever driven on ice and felt out of control, you might have begun to develop your Newtonian intuition.</p>

                                As usual, it is convenient to start with the picture to help decide on the appropriate coordinate system.
                                <!-- We can also list the information that we know. -->
                                We know <m>m_Z</m>, which is useful for relating <m>F_{Z,\mathrm{net}}</m> to <m>a_Z</m>.
                                We know <m>m_C</m>, which is useful for relating <m>F_{C,\mathrm{net}}</m> to <m>a_C</m>.
                                (This is not asked for, but is asked in homework problem <xref ref="hmwk-pushbrace" text="type-global" />.)
                                We know <m>F_{C,Z}</m>, how hard \studentZ\ pushes on \studentC.
                                We also know that \studentC\ is not bracing \himselfC\ (because \heC\ <q>has \hisC\ back turned</q>) so \heC\ only feels one force, and that \studentZ\ is bracing \himselfZ\ (because the problem states that \heZ\ <q>leans in</q>) so \heC\ exerts multiple forces.</p>

                                <p xml:id="ex-braced-want"><alert>What do we want to know?</alert>
                                We want to know about the forces acting on \studentZ, in order to find  <m>F_{Z,\textrm{net}}</m> and therefore <m>a_Z</m>.</p>

                                <p xml:id="ex-braced-infer"><alert>How are what-we-know and what-we-want related?</alert>
                                First, since \studentZ\ exerts a force on \studentC, Newton's third law tells us that \studentZ\ feels a force of <m>F_{Z,C}=-215 \unit{N}\ihat</m>.</p>
                                <p>Second, because \studentZ\ <em>knew</em> \heZ\ was going to feel this reaction force, \heZ\ compensates by bracing \himselfZ.  This means \heZ\ chooses to exert a force of <m>215\unit{N}</m> on the Earth in the <m>-\ihat</m> direction, probably by putting one leg behind \himselfZ\ and pushing the ground backwards with \hisZ\ foot.  Newton's third law then tells us that \studentZ\ feels a force of <m>F_{Z,C}=+215 \unit{N}\ihat</m> from the ground.</p>

                                <p><alert>Free-Body Diagrams</alert>
                                We are told of the force on \studentC.  We are told that \studentZ\ braces \himselfZ, which tells us the force on the Earth. Newton's third law then helps us recognize the forces on \studentZ.  (Recall the <xref ref="conv-on-by" text="title"><q>on-by</q> notation</xref>.)</p>

                                Newton's third law guarantees that the action-reaction force pairs, such as <m>F_{Z,C}</m> and <m>F_{C,Z}</m> or <m>F_{Z,E}</m> and <m>F_{E,Z}</m>, are equal and opposite.  There is no such guarantee on <m>F_{Z,C}</m> and <m>F_{Z,E}</m>.  These are equal because \studentZ\ chose to make <m>F_{C,Z}</m> and <m>F_{E,Z}</m> equal.  \HeZ\ pushed on the two others in equal amounts so that the reaction forces that act on \himZ\ will balance for Newton's <em>second</em> law so that \hisZ\ acceleration would be zero.</p>

                                <p>After using Newton's third law to find the forces on \studentZ, we can use Newton's second law to find \hisZ\ acceleration:
                                <me> a_Z = \frac{F_{Z,\mathrm{net}}}{m_Z} = \frac{\left[ \vec F_{Z,C} + \vec F_{Z,E} \right]}{\massZ} = \frac{\left[ \left( -215\unit N \ihat \right) + \left( +215\unit N \ihat \right) \right]}{\massZ} = 0 \unitfrac{m}{s^2}  </me></p>

                                We know <m>F_{C,D}</m>, how hard \studentD\ pushes on \studentC.

                                Newton's third law guarantees that the action-reaction force pairs, <m>F_{D,C}</m> and <m>F_{C,D}</m>, are equal and opposite.  Because these forces are not on the same person, we cannot add these forces.  Newton's second law will then indicate how each person accelerates.</p>

                                <p>After using Newton's third law to find the forces on \studentD, we can use Newton's second law to find \hisD\ acceleration:
                                <me> a_D = \frac{F_{D,\mathrm{net}}}{m_D} = \frac{\left[ \vec F_{D,C} \right]}{\massD} = \frac{\left[ \left( -215\unit N \ihat \right) \right]}{\massD} = -\sigfrac{2.68}{75}{m}{s^2} \ihat </me></p>

        <p>Having <xref ref="c-force" text="title">discussed the concept of forces</xref> and how they affect the motion, we can turn to the specific mechanisms for the introduction of forces on objects.  Perhaps the most obvious mechanisms for imparting force is that objects fall towards the Earth.  We call this force <q>gravity</q> and we will discuss it first.  It turns out to be somewhat more complicated because it turns out that the force that helps us fall when we trip is the same force that holds the planets in their orbits.  The complicated general theory will be discussed later, but for now <xref ref="s-Fg" text="type-local" /> will describe the phenomenon at the surface of the Earth where we usually experience it.</p>
<todo>add reference to the general theory</todo>

        <p>After a brief introduction to the four fundamental forces in <xref ref="s-fundamental" text="type-local" />, we will consider the <xref ref="s-FN" text="title">normal force</xref>, <xref ref="s-Ff" text="title">friction</xref>, <xref ref="s-FT" text="title">tension</xref> (such as in ropes), <xref ref="s-springs" text="title">springs</xref>, and end with the catch-all additional category of <xref ref="s-FA" text="title">applied forces</xref>.  <xref ref="s-Fnet" text="type-local" /> will wrap it up by using examples including multiple types of force to compute the net force, which connects back to Newton's Laws in the previous chapter.</p>

        <p>Before we start, let's consider extending the subscript notation for forces introduced in <xref ref="conv-on-by" text="type-global" />.</p>
        <aside><title>Convention referenced by</title>
                <p>
                <xref ref="conv-on-by" text="type-global" />,

        </aside>
        <convention xml:id="conv-on-by-type"><title>The <q>on-by-type</q> notation</title>
        <p>Recall <xref ref="conv-on-by" text="title" />.  Often we would like to indicate the type of force as well as which objects is it <q>on</q> or <q>by</q>.  In this chapter, we will add the type of force after the <q>on-by</q> notation.
        <notation>
        <usage>F_\mathrm{on, by, type}</usage>
        <description>Use of subscripts on force labels: If it is obvious which object feels the force, the subscript will only indicate <em>which force</em>.
                If it is not obvious which object feels the force, the subscript will also indicate which object the force is acted <em>on</em>.
                Sometimes we need to clarify who exerts the force as well as who feels the force.  In this case, the subscripts indicate who the force is <em>on</em>, who the force is <em>by</em>, and which force we are referring to: <m>F_\mathrm{on, by, type}</m>.
                </description>
        </notation>
        Considering the case where \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> feels a gravitational force from the Earth, we say that there is a gravitational force on \studentA\ by the Earth and use the notation <m>F_{AEg}</m>, where the first subscript is the person who felt the force (who the force is <q>on</q>), the second subscript is who exerted the force (who the force is <q>by</q>), and the third subscript is the type of force.</p>
        <p><alert>Caution 1:</alert> Sometimes it will be obvious who exerts the force and we might drop that subscript.  For example, the Earth is the most common source for the gravitational force, so we might write <m>F_{Ag}</m>, distinguishing this from the normal force that acts on \studentA, <m>F_{AN}</m> (which will also be exerted by an obvious source, the surface on which \studentA\ stands).</p>
        <p><alert>Caution 2:</alert> Sometimes the interacting objects and type will have the same initial and the subscripts can be confusing, as in the case where \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> <em>applies</em> a good-natured force to \studentA.  In that case, we would say that there is an applied force on \studentA\ by \studentB\ and use the notation <m>F_{ABa}</m> where the first subscript (A) is the person who felt the force and the last subscript is the type of force (applied).  The author of this book will endeavor to create examples which avoid this confusion, but if you create examples for yourself, just be aware of this possibility.</p>

        </aside>
                <p>Perhaps the force that is the most obvious to humanity is the one that helps us fall when we stumble: the gravitational force<idx><h>gravity</h><h>surface of Earth</h></idx>.  This is one of the fundamental forces discussed in <xref ref="s-fundamental" text="type-global" />.  In addition, the details about how the planets, moon, and the sun experience this force will be discussed in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global" />.  For now, we can consider how this interaction manifests itself on our daily lives.  In this section, we will start with how objects move when the gravitational force is the only force acting.  Subsections <xref ref="ss-weightmass" text="global" /> and <xref ref="ss-equivmm" text="global" /> will clarify some subtleties and then we'll jump into the examples in <xref ref="ss-local-mg" text="type-local" />.</p>

                <p>We can investigate what happens when the gravitational force is the only force acting on an object by holding it in the air and dropping it<idx>freefall</idx>.  One of the complications during such an experiment was discussed in <xref ref="ss-airresistance" text="type-hybrid" />.  If we drop a sheet of paper, there is air resistance in addition to the gravitational force.  For this section, I will assume that the mass-to-surface-area ratio is large enough that we can effectively ignore the air resistance.  A second consideration that allows this approximation is that (as discussed in <xref ref="ss-air-resistance" text="type-global" />) the air resistance depends on the speed of the object, so as long as the objects fall for a short distance or do not get a significant speed, then we can ignore air resistance.  You should note that when you are deciding is a speed is significant, consider that baseballs hit (fly balls) by college athletes do not follow a parabolic path because of air resistance.</p>
                <biographical><title>Touchstone (mostly true)</title><p>Recall <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effective theories</xref>. For the vast majority of objects we drop (through the atmosphere) we don't have to worry about air resistance.</p></biographical>

                <aside><title>Paragraph referenced by</title><p><xref ref="ex-inclined-plane" text="type-global" /></p></aside>
                <p xml:id="d-grav-coordinate-system">Before we get into too much detail, we should pause here and recognize that the force of gravity is likely the underlying reason for our intrinsically human perspective that vertical and horizontal are the <q>natural</q> orientation of any <xref ref="ss-coordinate-systems" text="title">coordinate system</xref>.  That is to say, it is the combination of the vector nature of <xref ref="as-NII" text="title" /> combined with the fact that gravity pulls (and therefore accelerates) objects <q>downwards</q> (by which we mean <q>towards the center of the Earth</q>).  When the object is in <xref ref="def-freefall" text="title">freefall</xref>, its acceleration is pointing along the vertical axis with no component along the horizontal axis.  The awareness of this makes the horizontal component of Newton's second law convenient because <m>F_{\text{net},x} = m \cancelto{0}{a_x}</m>.  On the other hand, if we drag something along the ground, then it has no vertical acceleration and only (possibly) a horizontal acceleration, which makes the vertical component convenient because <m>F_{\text{net},y} = m \cancelto{0}{a_y}</m>.  It is (nearly) always convenient (meaning <q>easier to solve mathematically</q>) if we can choose our coordinate system so that one of the components of the acceleration (either <m>a_x</m> or <m>a_y</m>) is equal to zero.</p>

                <p  xml:id="d-Fgrav">Since objects fall faster than humans are used to paying attention to, the patterns are difficult to see.  <xref ref="irl-freefall" text="type-hybrid" /> shows you how you can pay close attention to the patterns that result from observing falling objects.  You should go do those experiments before reading further.  Go ahead.  I'll wait.</p>

                <p xml:id="d-Fgball">You did do them, right?  You're not just reading ahead?  Really?  OK.  Doing that experiment will help you see (1) that everything falls at the same rate and (2) that objects accelerate as they fall.  This first point is a bit less intuitive and will be discussed further in <xref ref="ss-equivmm" text="type-hybrid" />.  This second point should be exactly what you expect, when you consider <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second Law</xref>: If there is only one force (the gravitational force), then the object cannot be in <xref ref="sss-equilibrium" text="title">equilibrium</xref> and it must be accelerating.  (You should notice that this is the language of <xref ref="st-Fma" text="title">the story of Newton's second law</xref>.)</p>

                <biographical><title>Touchstone (on-by)</title><p><xref ref="conv-on-by" text="title">the on-by notation</xref></p></biographical>
                <p>In order to evaluate this further, let's consider a specific object, like a baseball.  Our baseball has a mass of <m>m_b = 0.145\unit{kg}</m>.  If the only force acting <em>on</em> the ball is the gravitational force <em>by</em> the Earth, then the net force is the gravitational force: <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = \vec F_{bEg}</m>.
                Here the subscripts are <m>b</m> (because the force is on the <em>b</em>all), <m>E</m> (because the force is exerted by the <em>E</em>arth), and <m>g</m> (because it is a <em>g</em>ravitational force).  Since the acceleration is due to the gravitational force, I will use either <m>a_g</m> (usually when the object is in <xref ref="def-freefall" text="title">freefall</xref> and therefore accelerating at this rate) or <m>g</m> (usually when the object is not actually accelerating at that rate).  With this notation, Newton's second law becomes:
                <me> \vec F_{bEg} = m_b \vec a_g </me>
                At this point, we know the mass, but we don't know the force or the acceleration.  However, we have conveniently already done the experiment (recall <xref ref="ex-freefall" text="type-hybrid"/>) that will tell us the acceleration is <m>a_g = 9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m> downwards.  (Recall that <q>downwards</q> is the direction of the vector, which can be expressed as <m>-\jhat</m>.)  If we know the mass and the acceleration, then we can compute the force.</p>
                <todo>Should we introduce the idea of a gravitational field here?</todo>

                <example xml:id="se-weightball">
                        <title>Calculate the weight of a ball in freefall</title>
                        <statement>
                        <p>If a baseball with mass <m>m_b = 0.145\unit{kg}</m> is dropped (allowed to <xref ref="ss-freefall" text="title">fall freely</xref>) so that it accelerates at <m>a_g = 9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m> downwards, then while it falls it feels the gravitational force:
                        <me> \vec F_g = m \vec g = (0.145\unit{kg}) [-(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2})\,\jhat] = -\sig{1.42}{24}{N} \jhat = -1.42 \unit N \jhat </me>.

                        </statement>
                </example>

                <p>This is the force of the gravitational force on the baseball.  Although we computed the force while the ball was falling, the gravitational force does not magically vanish when the ball is sitting on the floor.  So, we can say that (as long as the ball is close to the surface of the Earth, as noted in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-hybrid" />) the force always has this value.  Rather than continuing to say <q>the force of gravity</q> we call this force the weight.</p>

                <p xml:id="p-defpound">Since all objects have the same acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth, the weight of an object and the mass of an object are very closely correlated, but they are not the same quantity.  This tends to cause some confusion when the discussion is not explicitly technical.  Recall the discussion about being precise in our language, <xref ref="s-precision" text="type-global" />.  One complication for people in the United States is that there are two definitions of the pound; one is a unit of mass<fn xml:id="fn-pound">There are also multiple versions of the pound-mass.  You can find these explained on the internet, but most of these are considered obsolete.  The one I will use is the <q>avoirdupois-pound</q>, which is defined in the NIST publication
                <!-- found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass) -->
                <url href="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/04/28/AppC-12-hb44-final.pdf">Handbook 44</url>, page C-19, as exactly <m>453.592 37\unit{g}</m>.</fn>
                and the other is a unit of force.  Since the pound-force<fn xml:id="fn-kg-pound">There is also a unit of force called the kilogram-force.</fn>
                <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(force) -->
                is defined as the standard unit of mass times the standard unit for the acceleration due to gravity, as discussed in <xref ref="s-SI-MKS" text="type-hybrid" />, the conversion directly from pound-force to Newtons will <em>not</em> match the longer, but more appropriate, conversion from pound-mass to kilogram that gets multiplied by the local acceleration due to gravity (as opposed to the standard <m>g</m>) into Newtons.  It may also be useful to review the comments about unit-conversion in the section on <xref ref="s-sigfig" text="title">significant digits</xref><idx>Significant Digits</idx>.</p>
                <todo>Update (xref ref="s-SI-MKS" text="type-hybrid" /) with this information.</todo>

                <p xml:id="p-weightmass">In the discussion about <xref ref="p-massive" text="title">being precise</xref>, we distinguished <q>massive</q> (the amount) from <q>voluminous</q> (the size).  Now that we understand <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref>, we can distinguish <q>massive</q>
                (an amount of material causing a difficulty in making accelerate)

                        <p>The mass describes the amount of material, whereas weight describes how strongly the gravitational force pulls on the object.</p></remark>
                <p>Having mass affects both the inertia (ease of moving) and the weight (force of gravity).
                Having weight expresses the gravitational force due to whichever large object (moon, planet, sun, etc.) you happen to be on or near.  Noticing that the SI-unit (<xref ref="s-SI-MKS" text="type-global" />) is different for different types of quantities, such as a kilogram (a <xref ref="p-fundamental" text="title">fundamental unit</xref>) for mass and a Newton (a <xref ref="p-derived" text="title">derived unit</xref>) for weight, may help you remember that these are different kinds of quantities.</p>

                <p>The interesting aspect of this relationship is that while having more mass makes an object harder to move (the same force produces less acceleration for more massive objects), when objects fall under the influence of the gravitational force, they accelerate at the <em>same</em> rate.  This reveals that the gravitational force must be stronger for more massive objects <em>by the exact amount</em> needed to compensate for that larger mass.  This is called the equivalence principle and is discussed in <xref ref="ss-equivmm" text="type-hybrid" />.</p>

                <p>When calculating the forces acting on a person or an object, we will often need to account for the force of gravity, while other forces may also be at work.  As mentioned above, the weight is found by multiplying the mass times the local acceleration due to gravity, even if the object is not actually accelerating at that rate.  <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global" /> will clarify why it is true<fn xml:id="fn-accgrav-nuance">The short answer is that the altitude (distance from the surface of the Earth) and local geology affect the strength of the gravitational field.  Since the Earth is slightly oblate (bulges at the equator), the altitude at different latitudes corresponds to a different distance from the center of the Earth.  In addition, while the spin of the Earth does not affect the strength of the gravitational field, it does affect how objects accelerate. The <url href="http://www2.csr.utexas.edu/grace/gallery/animations/ggm01/ggm01_gif-200.html">GRACE project</url> has measured the variations across the globe.</fn>, but for now please note that the acceleration due to gravity is (1) different according to where we are and also (2) the same for all objects at that location.<idx><h>acceleration</h><h>gravity</h></idx><idx><h>gravity</h><h>acceleration</h></idx>

                        <p>If \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> is not falling, but rather standing safely on the floor, then the gravitational force is still acting.  It can be computed as
                                <me> \vec F_g = m \vec g = (\massB) [-(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2})\,\jhat] = -\sig{735}{.75}{N} \jhat = -736 \unit N \jhat </me>
                        However, since we can see that \hisB\ acceleration is zero, the <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net}</m> <em>must be zero</em>.  The only way that can happen, though is if there is another force acting upwards on \studentB.  What could possibly be pushing up on \himB?  <xref ref="A-floor" text="type-local" />.  Whatever it is pushing up on \himB, it is supplying a support force, which can be calculated since
                                <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = \vec F_g + \vec F_\mathrm{support}</m>
                        and we can solve for
                                <me> \vec F_\mathrm{support} = \vec F_\mathrm{net} - \vec F_g = m\left(0\unitfrac{m}{s^2}\right) - \left[ -(\sig{735}{.8}{N}) \jhat\right] = +736\unit N \jhat </me>
                        Because it is in the direction opposite to <m>\vec F_g</m>, it is upwards <m>(+\jhat)</m>.</p>

                        <p>Can you identify <em>why</em> the support force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the gravitational force?

                        <answer xml:id="A-floor"><p>I hope you guessed the floor.  That is the only thing pushing up on \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>.  One useful way to think about it is that the floor is the thing keeping \himB\ from falling.  The direction of this force is <em>normal</em> (perpendicular) to the horizontal floor, so it is in the vertical direction.  This will be discussed in more detail in <xref ref="s-FN" text="type-global"/>.</p></answer>

                        <answer xml:id="A-second"><p>You can tell that it is Newton's second law <m>(\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m \vec a)</m> because the forces we are considering are acting on the <em>same</em> object.  In this case, the gravitational force is caused by the Earth and the normal force is caused by the floor by they are both felt by \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>.  These forces happen to be equal and opposite because \heB\ happens to be in equilibrium. \HeB\ does not <em>have to be</em> in equilibrium, such as when \heB\ jumps, in which case the forces would not be equal and might not be opposite. </p> </answer>

                        <answer xml:id="A-third"><p>If it were Newton's third law, then the two forces we were discussing would be acting on different objects and would be unrelated to the fact that the object (in this case, \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>) is in equilibrium.  The gravitational force and the normal force in this case are both acting on \studentB, so although they happen to be equal and opposite, this is not due to Newton's third law.</p>

                        <p>You should, however, note that the force that is reaction-paired to the gravitational force on \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> by the Earth is a gravitational force on the Earth by \studentB.  Similarly, the reaction-paired force to the normal force on \studentB\ by the floor is a normal force on the floor by \studentB.  (Please note the <q>on</q> and <q>by</q> in each case.)</p></answer>
                </example>

                <p>As was mentioned earlier, the value of the acceleration due to gravity also varies across the surface, although this is less than about a percent or so (see <xref ref="t-gworld" text="type-hybrid"/>).  Nonetheless, this means that your weight can change even when your mass remains the same.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>know which section of the book to read to find more information about the fundamental forces?</p></li>
			</ul>
		</objectives>

        <todo>Should I give more information about "if you are near a large (planetary) body, then you should include gravity" and "if you have electrical charges then you should..." etc?</todo>
        <p>The previous section describes our (macroscopic) experience of the gravitational interaction when standing on the surface of the Earth.  This is essentially the same across the surface, but does change with altitude and the difference can be measured on mountain tops and in caves.  In fact, one can use the differences from one location to another to predict where we might find a a pocket of oil.</p>

        <p xml:id="d-fundamental">In later sections, we will consider this and other interactions that depend on the physical properties, such as mass and charge.  All particles with the property of mass (which we will start to call gravitational charge) will interact according to the gravitational force; however, this description is better described by the mathematics in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global"/>.  All particles with the property of electrical charge will interact according to the electrical force.  The basic theory will be discussed in <xref ref="c-electric" text="type-global"/>.  A more complicated version that incorporates quantum mechanics is called quantum electrodynamics (QED) and this will be touched on in <xref ref="ss-QED" text="type-global" />.  Particles like protons and neutrons (hadrons) are actually made up of other particles (quarks) that are held together by an interaction that is sometimes called the strong nuclear force (<xref ref="ss-strong" text="type-global" />) and is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD); this will be touched on in <xref ref="ss-QCD" text="type-global" />.  Finally, in <xref ref="ss-weak" text="type-global"/> another fundamental force, called the weak nuclear force, will be discussed.</p>

        <p>For the most part, these theories describe the interaction between microscopic particles, so we will not discuss them in detail here.  However, the gravitational interaction is exception in a variety of ways.  In particular, the gravitational interaction does affect macroscopic objects.  These fundamental forces have a particular description that allows us to pretend (recall <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effective theories</xref>) that they are action-at-a-distance interactions.  All other forces (introduced next) will require physical contact in order to exert the force.</p>

                <p>The word <q>normal</q> <url href="http://www.etymonline.com/word/normal">originates</url><idx>normal</idx> with the idea of conformity to the pattern.  While in everyday life this pattern is the typical state of being, the origins actually refer to a carpenter's square, which put corners into a right angle.  In math and physics, the word is used to mean perpendicular.</p>

                <insight xml:id="insight-normal-surface"><p>In the context of forces, the normal force is the force that a surface exerts to keep objects from passing through them.  The direction of this force is always in the outward direction, normal (perpendicular) to the surface.</p></insight>

                <todo>Do we need to repeat the example here? no?</todo>
                <p>Let's consider some specific situations<ellipsis /> In <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />, \studentB\ felt the downwards gravitational force even while \heB\ was standing on the ground.  We noticed that \heB\ was not falling (and so not accelerating).  Colloquially, we say that the ground is supporting \studentB.  This support force is keeping \studentB\ from passing through the floor; this is a normal force.  The normal force from the floor is acting upwards, which is normal (perpendicular) to the surface of the floor.  <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" /> updates the free-body diagrams of <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> to show how the gravitational and normal forces impact that calculation.</p>

                <example xml:id="f-firstFBDupdate">
                        <title>People pushing a box also feel the gravitational and the normal forces</title>
                        <idx><h>free-body diagrams</h><h>images</h></idx>

                        <aside><title>Example referenced by</title><p><xref ref="p-intro-inclined-planes" text="title">Introduction of inclined planes</xref></p></aside>
                        <p>Let's start from a familiar example so that we focus our attention on the <em>new</em> aspect.  Starting from <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" />, we can observe that each of the three bodies also has a downwards gravitational force.  This is analogous to the calculation in <xref ref="se-weightA" text="type-global" />, which was only for \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx>; but you can calculate the weight for the mass in <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" /> and \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>'s weight was computed in <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />.  In addition to the downward gravitational force (the weight), Newton's second law and the fact that nothing is accelerating up or down together tells us that there must also be a normal force on each body.  This is analogous to the calculation in <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />, which was only for \studentB; but you can deduce it for the object and for \studentA.</p>

                                <p>In order to find the force, we will first need to find the acceleration.
                                        <me> \vec a = \frac{\vec v_f-\vec v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{(0\unitfrac ms)-(13.0\unitfrac ms \ihat)}{0.243\unit s} = -\sigfrac{53.4}{9}{m}{s^2}\ihat </me>
                                That the acceleration is in the direction opposite the velocity corresponds to the object slowing down.  Now we can find the <term>net force</term> from Newton's second law:

                                There are three forces acting on the car, as can be seen in analogy with the free-body diagrams of <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" />.  So, we can draw a free-body diagram here as well.</p>

                <p>Some digital scales are inconvenient for understanding how they work because they don't display the value until it has come to something close to equilibrium.  If you have access to an analog scale, then you can watch the value change as it settles down and it might be easier to build your intuition.</p>

                <p>As you consider the values that you read on the scale, you should consider what happens if you jump off of or land upon a scale.  <em>Note that actually doing this can decalibrate your scale, if not break it entirely.  Scales are not meant to be handled this way.</em> While you are jumping from your scale, it must provide not only the force necessary to support your weight, but also the upwards force require to accelerate you upwards.  While you are landing on the scale, it musty provide not only the force necessary to support your weight, but also the upwards force necessary to decelerate you.</p>

                <p>Bathroom scales use leverage (i.e., <xref ref="s-leverarm" text="title">torque</xref>) and a <xref ref="s-springs" text="title">spring</xref>-system to balance the force pressing into them.

                        <p>The study of inclined planes is important in introductory physics because it provides an example of a situation where it makes more sense (by which I am makes the math easier) to use a coordinate system that is not the usual horizontal-and-vertical.  It is still useful (and will always be) to have the axes be perpendicular to each other.  See the discussion in <xref ref="h-inclined-components" text="type-local" /> for the relevant reasoning.</p>

                <p><xref ref="sum-NewtonsLaws" text="title">Recall</xref> that the third law tells us about what happens to the object that is doing the pushing.  In <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" />, the gravitational and normal forces were included.  In the same way that <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> explained the way the third law describes the sources of the horizontal forces on the object (by adding the people to <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="type-global" />), we can now consider the source of the vertical forces.  The gravitational forces pulling down on the people and the object are caused by the gravitational interaction with the Earth.  Since the Earth is pulling them down, the <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title">third law</xref> indicates that they must pull the Earth up <em>with a gravitational force</em>.   These pairs of gravitational forces (Earth pulling down on the object and the object pulling up on the Earth, etc.) are <q>third-law pairs</q> (recall <xref ref="insight-force-type" text="type-global" />).</p>

                <p>Similarly, the normal forces that support the people and the object (against the gravitational force) are caused by the Earth's surface, which is keeping the people and objects from moving through that surface.  Since the Earth's surface is pushing them up, the third law indicates that they must push the Earth down <em>with a normal force</em> (keeping the Earth from moving through their feet).   These pairs of normal forces (Earth pushing up on the object and the object pushing down on the Earth, etc.) are <q>third-law pairs</q> (recall <xref ref="insight-force-type" text="type-global" />).</p>

                        <p>You should notice the language in the paragraph above.  While the normal force does act against the gravitational force (in this case), the normal force is not the third-law pair to the gravitational force.

        <p>Recalling the <xref ref="p-intuition-motion" text="title">discussion about Newton's first law</xref>, friction is the force that affects our intuition about how objects move.  Friction is the force that is usually thought of as the reason that objects slow down, but it is also the reason we are able to move forward when we walk and to turn corners when we drive (for example).  Whenever objects move, the motion is measured by what they move past.  The four situations we (as humans living on Earth) are most familiar with are
        <ul>
                <li><p>sliding across the ground,</p></li>
                <li><p>rolling along the ground,</p></li>
                <li><p>soaring through the air, and </p></li>
                <li><p>gliding through the water.</p></li>
        </ul>
        Each of these actions allow us to experience friction in a different way.  If we start with sliding, then we can establish the concepts with some fairly simple mathematics and address the cases of trying to walk and turn a car.  The concepts we will want to pay attention to in that case are the roughness of the surfaces that are in contact and the amount they are pressed together.  Rolling friction will use these same ideas, but will apply them in a different way.  The discussion of air resistance (and water resistance) will modify these ideas a bit, considering the thickness of the gas (or fluid) through which the object moves and the shape of the object.  The shape of the object affects the aerodynamics (or hydrodynamics), which informs us about the amount of impact the gas (or fluid) has on the front of the object and is similar (conceptually) to the amount the surfaces are pressed together.</p>

                <introduction>
                <p>Sliding friction is relevant to any problem in which one object is <q>trying to</q> move across another.  You should note that the objects do not actually have to be moving across each other for this to be relevant.  If they are moving across each other, then we will need to consider the kinetic friction (<xref ref="sss-kinetic" text="type-local" />).  If, on the other hand, you imagine pushing a heavy couch across a carpeted floor, then you can picture a case where the horizontal force is not sufficient to overcome the frictional force.  In this case, we will consider the static friction (<xref ref="sss-static" text="type-local" />).  </p>

                </aside>

                <p xml:id="p-friction-herky-jerky">For both static and kinetic friction, we will consider the case of pushing on an object to get it to slide across the floor or a table or some other surface.  For example, you can place your shoe on the floor and push it gently with your foot so that it doesn't move (static) or harder so that it does move (kinetic).  If you are using a rubber-soled shoe, then you might notice that the shoe moves in a herky-jerky fashion.  We will not be considering motion that comes in fits-and-starts because that indicates that the acceleration is changing, which (as discussed in <xref ref="ss-multistep" text="type-global" />, and especially <xref ref="ex-ceiling" text="type-global" />) means that we cannot use the <xref ref="d-EOM" text="title">basic equations of motion for constant acceleration</xref>. </p>

For a fair comparison, you should also consider a cinder block and a chair being slid across a slightly wet counter (!), a cinder block being dragged across a hardwood floor (do not try that at home) and a carpet, and a heavy chair being slid across paved and gravel roads.</p>
                                                <p>You may also note that if the object you are dragging across a carpet is heavy enough, then the carpet might bunch-up in front of the object.  This does not make for a good comparison.  Similarly, the gravel is not really comparable because you will likely be digging ruts in the gravel, which takes more effort and is not equivalent to the friction seen in the other cases.</p>

                                                <p>The chair will experience more friction than the cinder block, which experiences more friction than the mug.  To produce a fair comparison, you should consider dragging objects with various weights across the same surface.  Furthermore, you should not use a surface (such as a gravel road) in which the object being dragged can pull the material of the surface along with it, creating ruts in the surface because that involves moving the material rather than simply sliding across it.</p>

                                                <p>The slightly wet counter will provide less friction than the hardwood floor (or a dry counter), which provides less than the paved road.  Assuming the carpet is a flat carpet (as opposed to a shaggy carpet), it is likely that this will be somewhere between the hardwood floor and the gravel road, but there is enough variation in these types of surface that this is not necessarily obvious without an experiment.  To produce a fair comparison, you should drag the same object across each of the different surfaces.</p>

                                <p>If one object is above the other, then the weight contributes to the amount they are pressed together, but since objects can have friction when they rub their sides across each other (like a <url href="http://bitsandpieces.us/2013/11/tight-squeeze/">truck squeezing through a narrow alleyway</url>), the weight cannot be the explicit quantity.  It turns out that the <xref ref="s-FN" text="title">normal force</xref> is the quantity that expresses how strongly objects are being pressed together because it reflects the force needed to keep one object from passing through the other.</p>

                                        <p>Since the full mug has a larger normal force, it does have a larger frictional force than the empty mug.

                                        <p>Since the empty mug has a smaller mass, you might expect it to have a larger acceleration (according to Newton's second law), but that conclusion assumes that the force is the same, which is not true.  The empty mug has a smaller mass and a smaller frictional force (because it has a smaller normal force).  The relevant equation is Newton's second law in the horizontal direction with friction as the only horizontal force: <m>F_f = ma</m>.  Since both the frictional force and the mass are half of that for the full mug, the acceleration is the same for both mugs.  The empty mug does not stop before the full mug.</p></answer>

                        <p>Since directly proportional indicates a linear relationship, you are probably thinking of the equation of a line, <m>y=mx+b</m>.

The proportionality constant we use is called the <term>coefficient of friction</term><idx><h>friction</h><h>coefficient of</h></idx> and the symbol is <m>\mu</m>, which is the Greek letter equivalent to the English letter <q>m</q>.

                                <p>The direction of the frictional force is <em>necessarily</em> along the plane of the surface, whereas the normal force is <em>necessarily</em> normal (perpendicular) to the plane of the surface.<fn>Some sources include this in the statement of <xref ref="law-friction-amontons-1" text="title" />, stating <q>When a body is moving, the friction is directly proportional to normal force and frictional force direction is perpendicular to the normal force.</q></fn>  This is a <q>magnitude</q> relationship.</p>

However, assuming that you are pulling at a slight upwards angle, you are helping to support the weight and the normal force does not need to be as large.  (If we had numbers, you could use the vertical components to find the magnitude of the normal force.)  The friction, however, does not help lift the chair, nor weigh it down; friction only interferes with the backward pulling.  It is parallel to the ground in the direction opposite the motion. If you are accelerating the chair backwards, then the applied force has a larger horizontal component than the frictional force.</p>

                                        <p>As you start relaxing your pull, the chair still has its weight pulling it down and the normal force keeping it from falling through the ground.  However, assuming that you are still pulling at a slight upwards angle, you are helping to support the weight and the normal force does not need to be as large.  (If we had numbers, you could use the vertical components to find the magnitude of the normal force.)  The friction, however, does not help lift the chair, nor weigh it down; friction only interferes with the backward pulling.  It is parallel to the ground in the direction opposite the motion.  If you are decelerating the chair backwards, then the applied force has a smaller horizontal component than the frictional force.</p>

                                        and solve for the displacement <m>(\Delta x)</m>.  In order to do this, we need the initial and final velocities and the acceleration.  We are given the initial velocity and, since the mug comes <xref ref="d-at-rest" text="title">to rest</xref>, we can easily deduce the final velocity <m>(0\unitfrac{m}{s})</m>.  As usual (recall <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" />), we can find the acceleration from Newton's second law (the hints give the justification for the steps)

                                                <li><p>that you do not literally need to find the value of the normal or frictional forces.</p></li></ol>

                                        <p>Given the acceleration, we can find the displacement:

                                <p>A chair on a hard-wood floor is different from a rubber-soled shoe on hard wood and both of these are different from that same chair (or shoe) on ceramic tile.  It is not useful to talk about the friction caused by the floor independently of what is moving across the floor.  Furthermore, it depends on how those surfaces interact.  On the one hand, it is safe to conceptualize this as the rougher the surfaces, the more places they have to grab each other.  On the other hand, there is also the effect of very flat, smooth surfaces:  If two very flat, smooth surfaces are in contact, they have a <q>stickiness</q> that interferes with the easy of sliding past each other.  For example, when you get an oil change in your car, they will often provide a small plastic reminder tag that sticks to your windshield with significant friction, but without stickiness.  <em>The information about how these surfaces interact is encoded in the coefficient of friction.</em><idx><h>friction</h><h>coefficient of</h></idx>  (See also <xref ref="fn-friction-mu" text="type-local" /> in <xref ref="law-friction-amontons-2" text="title" /> below, which indicates that some engineering texts indicate this as another law of friction.)</p>

                                <p>One would not be wrong to imagine that the broader something is, the more it interacts with the surface it is dragged along, much like how a picnic blanket (or superhero cape!) collects many more twigs and leaves when it is held open and wide while being dragged through the park than when it is dragged by one corner. On the other hand, you might also notice that when you stand on the bed, you sink in further than when you lay on the bed.  It turns out that while more surface does tend to increase the opportunity for friction, this is balanced by the reduced pressure due to having the weight spread out<fn xml:id="fn-friction-area">Recall <xref ref="p-pressure" text="title">discussion of the units of pressure</xref>.</fn>, thereby maintaining the same normal force regardless<fn>You might be relieved to learn that this is only mostly true.

                        <p><xref ref="law-friction-coulomb" text="title" /> turns out to be extremely convenient.  Because of this law, we can do <xref ref="ex-friction-mug" text="type-local" />.

                                <p>The obvious question, if you have heard the phrase <q>energy is never created nor destroyed, only changed or transferred</q>, is: Where does the lost energy go?  Clearly this discussion will have to wait until we learn the language of energy (in <xref ref="c-energy" text="type-global" />), but we can start that conversation. Consider smoothing a piece of wood with sandpaper.  There is a significant amount of friction.  In this process, you are breaking off rough edges of the wood and detaching the sand from the sand paper.  Those actions take effort. You are also moving the small particles that are broken off, which carries energy and momentum from the motion of the sandpaper.  If you do this long enough, you will notice that the sandpaper and wood also get warmer.  Friction is both <xref ref="d-workverb" text="title">doing work</xref> and <xref ref="d-heatverb" text="title">heating</xref>.  The friction when you vigorously rub your hands together involves much less <q>breaking off particles</q> but a similar amount of heating.  Dragging an object across gravel or dirt involves rearranging small particles, but less heating.</p>

                                        <p>Since lifting requires your fingers to not slide along the glass, this is a situation that requires static friction, not kinetic friction.  It does not matter that the glass will be accelerating upwards (with your hand); rather, what matters is that your fingers are not moving across the glass.</p>

If this is larger than the weight, then we have produced enough frictional force to lift the glass.  If the maximum frictional force is less than the weight, then this will not lift the glass.  So we are actually computing the minimal normal force necessary to just balance the weight, and then any amount of normal force larger than this will lift the glass with acceleration and any normal force smaller than this will allow the glass to slip out from between our fingers.</p>

The normal force is squeezing against the side of the glass.  The frictional force is opposing the downwards gravitational force.  So, the normal force is horizontal (into the surface, as normal forces always are) and the frictional force is vertical (along the surface, as frictional forces always are).  You should be able to draw the free-body diagram.</p>

                                                <p>The object sliding across the cover is accelerating.  The explanation for this is that there is some amount of force that breaks the static friction (gets it to move).  Since amount of force is the component of the gravitational force that is directed along the incline; this will be explained <xref ref="p-friction-inclined" text="title">below</xref>.  This component of gravity is the same all the way down.  This is just barely larger than friction as it escapes static friction and starts to move, but must be more than <em>barely larger</em> than kinetic friction in order to accelerate enough to notice.</p>

You should not conflate Newton's first law about changing the state of motion with the need to overcome friction.  Friction is a force that describes the way surfaces interact with each other.  The inertia is a property that is independent of friction and is true regardless of contact with other surfaces.  According to Newton's laws, without friction, it takes the same effort to change the velocity of an object from <m>0\unitfrac{m}{s}</m> to <m>2\unitfrac{m}{s}</m> as it does to change from <m>5\unitfrac{m}{s}</m> to <m>7\unitfrac{m}{s}</m>.  Furthermore, friction is only relevant where there are surfaces in contact and we can change the inertia with any force.</p>

                        <paragraphs xml:id="p-friction-walking"><title>How we walk</title>
                        <p>There are many examples where friction is our friend.  Walking is an example that is easy to overlook since we do that so often.  However, the process is very similar to other situations where it is painfully obvious.  Consider the online videos of animals (including people) trying to stand up (from an incline position) on ice.  Imagine how you get out of a chair if you don't trust your legs to support you.  Consider that many sports have cleats as part of their shows to get a better grip.  This <q>grip</q> is quite explicitly the effect of friction allowing you to move your body in specific ways.  During this discussion of walking, I would also like you to be thinking of the cutting-back-and-forth motion that is common in racquetball, tennis, basketball, volleyball, soccer, and football, not to mention the need for leverage (i.e., <xref ref="s-leverarm" text="title">torque</xref>) in hitting a baseball or softball, wrestling, golf, and any event in track and field.</p>

                        <p xml:id="p-walk-step">Rather than discussing the initiation of the walking motion, let's consider a person who is already walking.  (Ask a friend to walk along a hallway without being self-conscious so you can study them.) We should consider both feet during the walk.  Let's <alert>start with the landing of the front foot</alert>, then consider the shifting of weight from the back foot to the front foot, and end with the lifting of the back foot.  Generally people land their foot on their heel.  You may have had the experience of having that heel slide forwards out from under you, which is not a pleasant experience. Since that forward-foot would slide forwards without friction, it should be clear (from <xref ref="as-NII" text="title" />) that the frictional force holding your foot in place must be backwards, against your forward-motion.  Having this force on the bottom of your foot stops your foot while allowing your leg and body to continue to move (from <xref ref="as-NI" text="title" />) forwards. Furthermore, while your foot is feeling this backwards force, it is exerting a forwards force on the Earth (as indicated by <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title" />).  This may not be obvious unless your forward-foot lands on anything with wheels, a sock (or other clothing) on a hardwood floor, or a stray piece of paper; you should notice that whatever you might step on slides forwards out from your foot indicating that it feels a forwards force from your foot.</p>

                        <p xml:id="p-walk-shift">While both feet are on the ground and you <alert>shift your weight from the back lag to the front</alert>, your are doing two things.  With your front foot, you are laying the rest of your foot on the ground to support your weight across a larger area. (see the discussion of <xref ref="p-pressure" text="title">pressure</xref> and recall <xref ref="law-friction-amontons-2" text="title" />.)  This foot becomes the pivot point about which your body rotates, sort of like an inverted pendulum (see <xref ref="sss-pendulum" text="type-global" />), and as such needs to be stationary.  (Contrast this with ice skating in <xref ref="inv-walking" text="type-local" />.)  It is this recognition that your foot is stationary despite the motion of your body that tells you that static friction, rather than kinetic friction is relevant.  What about the back foot?  Although your toes are static, your moving leg is lifting your heel off the ground.  This ideally prepares your foot for the third motion of walking in that it stretches the muscles that are on the bottom of your feet.  Our muscles do their work by contracting and our limbs (hands and feet) have their strongest muscles on the inside of the gripping/curling motion<fn>When I describe the curling of your foot, you should think of the way you move your toes when you are asked to <q>curl your toes</q>.  That is you curl your toes down, not up.  Similarly, your calf is stronger than your shin because walking involves curling your foot towards your heel and calf, not up towards your shin.</fn>.</p>

                        <p xml:id="p-walk-push">In the final motion, while you <alert>lift your back foot</alert>, your calf contracts and pulls your heel up and your toes down.  Simultaneously, the muscles on the bottom of your foot contract pulling your toes into the ground and pushing the ground out from under you.  That is, your toes are pushing the ground backwards.  By <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title" />, the ground is intrinsically also pushing your foot forwards; this is the process that propels you forward.  As evidence of this, you might note that people who walk a lot or quickly tend to have larger calves.  If you have ever ice skated or used roller-skates or roller-blades, you will notice that the usual walking motion is not very efficient at beginning to move from a standing position.</p>

Have them walk quickly for a little while and slowly for a little while to see if anything becomes more obvious or less.

You will note that the toe of the crutch is usually rubber in order to increase the friction with the floor.  If you have ever needed to walk with crutches, then you will be keenly aware of the stress involved in the being aware of what you are placing the crutch onto.  This is especially true if you have inadvertently put the crutch onto a piece of paper while walking. If you have a pair of crutches and can adjust them to your proper height, hobbling on them for the better part of an afternoon will give you a new appreciation for the advantages of friction when you step.  You will also notice that without crutches your foot is explicitly pushing the ground backwards (so that the ground pushes you forwards) because the crutches do not do that.  When you walk with crutches, you have to plan for your momentum to carry you through until your weight is back on your other foot. </p></statement></task>

These boots touch the ground in wider area than a crutch and so it is much easier to <q>find purchase</q> and your attention about where your foot lands is more natural.  However, the walking boots generally do not allow you to bend your ankle, which also removes your ability to push off when the boot is your back foot.  If you are in this situation, then you should pay attention to your gait.  Some people hop off their good foot more than when they walk.  Some use their weaker leg in a different way.  If you are wearing a walking boot, then try to attend to which muscles are being used in an unusual way (by noticing which ones get tired more quickly than usual).</p></statement></task>
                                <task xml:id="task-walking-skating">
                                        <statement><p>Contrast walking with <alert>skating</alert> either on ice skates, roller skates, or roller blades.  I will consider ice skating, but the other forms have similar characteristics.  When skating there is an additional aspect of the process described above.  Once you are moving, you place one foot forwards and shift your weight over to that foot, but the shifting of your weight produces a sideways motion that allows you to twist your back foot (like a cow kick<fn>Note that cows tend to kick by sweeping out to the side and horses tend to kick straight back -- explaining the term <q>cow kick</q> -- but both animals are able to kick either way.</fn>) and push off the ice.  You can see this in play if you watch speed skating (an olympic sport).  The additional aspect of skating is that the skater takes much longer to move their back foot up to become the front foot, making this motion the part that takes the most time. You might also notice that ice skates have a <q>jagged toe</q> that allow the front tip to be used to grip the ice while the flat bladed bottom can slide smoothly along the ice.</p>
                                        <p>Two aspects to notice about ice skating which develop insight for walking (and friction).  First, when you step forward on skates, you place your foot flat rather than heel-first because you want to keep gliding and you don't want to stop by driving your heel into the ground.  Second, the jagged toe emphasizes that it is the toe that you push off with both in skating and in walking.  The friction of pushing the ground backwards is what enables the ground to push you forwards.</p></statement></task>

The name cartwheel is reminiscent of having your limbs play the roll of spoke on the wheel of a cart, which is a nice segue to the next section on <xref ref="ss-friction-rolling" text="title" />.  If you are comfortable doing a cartwheel, then you should pay attention to the action you use with your hands as you roll over.  You might also try to do a roundoff and decide if the way your hands interact with the ground is different.  You might note that some people do the roundoff with a push so that they bounce into the air and land on their feet.  If you do this a couple of times and imagine that your feet and hands are hitting a patch of slippery ice, you should be able to build your intuition about how static friction helps you walk.</p></statement></task>

                                        <p>When a surface is tilted at a gradually increasing angle, the <term>angle of repose</term> is the angle at which an object just breaks the static friction and begins to slide down the surface.</p></statement>

                        <p>Because of <xref ref="p-friction-static-larger" text="type-global" />, after the object begins to slide, it will accelerate down the ramp, rather than sliding at a constant speed.  On the other hand, since the surface (especially if it is unpolished wood) will likely have variable roughness along its length, it is possible that the coefficient of friction is different in different sections of the surface and the object might get stuck at some lower location.</p>

                                        <p>Based on <xref ref="answer-friction-below-repose" text="type-local" />, we will find the static friction.  Based on <xref ref="p-friction-static-variable" text="type-global" />, it will not help to use <xref ref="eq-friction-static" text="title">Equation</xref> because the coefficient of static friction only tells us the maximum static friction and we are below the angle of repose.  Since the component of the gravitational force along the slide is down the slide, the frictional force must be upwards along the slide.

                        <p>Comparing and contrasting kinetic friction, static friction, and rolling friction is often difficult because the motion of the object is so different.  Static and kinetic are likely pretty intuitive in that (1) the object is either moving or it isn't and (2) the objects are (or are trying to) slide against each other.  Rolling friction, on the other hand, looks rather different.  The surfaces are in contact, but it is not always obvious if they are sliding against each other.  If you do an internet search, you will find that some authors group rolling friction in with kinetic (or dynamic) friction because the objects (I will say the center-of-mass of the objects) have some relative motion and you will find other authors who indicate that it should be compared to static friction because there is no relative motion between the surfaces of the objects.</p>

                        <remark xml:id="clarify-no-slip"><title>Rolling without slipping</title>
                                <p>There are three categories of motion we will consider in the discussion around friction.
                                <ol>
                                        <li>Objects that are sliding (and not rolling) will experience kinetic friction (unless they are on a frictionless surface, of course).</li>
                                        <li>Objects that are <q>rolling without slipping</q> will experience rolling friction and not kinetic friction.  This case assumes that there is sufficient static friction to keep the object rolling rather than sliding, but the static friction is not <em>interfering</em> with the motion, rather it is the process that <em>allows</em> the rotation.</li>
                                        <li>Objects that are both rolling and sliding (think of skidding out in your car).  While this text will acknowledge the existence of such motion, the mathematical description of such is beyond the scope of this course.</li>
                                </ol></p>
                        </remark>

                        <p>Some of this will be easier to describe after we have the language of rotations (see <xref ref="s-rotation-language" text="type-global" />) but for now suffice it to say that a rolling object, such as a bicycle wheel, has an axis-of-rotation (the wheel's axle) which <em>is moving</em> relative to the ground and, if it is not slipping, has a surface in contact with the ground that <em>is not moving</em> relative to the ground.  The wheel surface is placed on the ground (not dragged along the ground) in much the same way as your hands are placed on the ground when you do a <xref ref="task-walking-cartwheel" text="title">cartwheel</xref>.  You can build some intuition by considering <xref ref="irl-rolling-friction" text="type-global" />.</p>

                                                <ul>

                                        To be clear, the risks are small if you are close to the standard pressure and don't drive much.  The further you are from the standard pressure and the more you drive, the bigger the risk.
                                        While you can find good information about tire inflation with a quick internet search, in October of 2017, <url href="https://www.discounttiredirect.com/learn/tire-pressure" /> had some good images of tires and the inappropriate wear patterns.</p></conclusion>

                                        <p>We should also describe some additional effects that can accompany what you just observed in the Investigation.
                                        <ul>
                                                <li><p>A tire without a car feels static friction to allow it to roll, but not kinetic friction (assuming it is not sliding along the ground).</p></li>
                                                <li><p>A tire that is connected to a car necessarily has a connection (at the axle) to the car, which is not rotating.  This means that there is necessarily some kinetic friction at that connection, although this is lubricated friction, not dry-sliding friction.  This connection is typically done with ball bearings, which means that there is additional friction in the case of the tire-and-car that is not present for the tire-alone.  Ball-bearings should also have rolling friction rather than kinetic friction and should be <url href="http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/cof.htm#mu_lagers">designed to minimize the frictional effects</url>.</p></li>

Amontons (ADD XREFS-ABOVE) in 1699 and contemporaries, <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke">Robert Hooke</url> (of <xref ref="as-hooke" text="title" /> fame) and Liebnitz who contributed to the studies of rolling friction.  Hooke with surface yielding and adhesion; Liebnitz with distinguishing static and rolling friction. Leonard Euler distinguished static and kinetic friction in the mid 1700's with the angle of repose.  Coulomb, among others, contributed in the late 1700's (Coulomb specifically started in 1779).  <xref ref="bib-friction-popov2017" /> indicates that Coulomb studied what is now called the adhesion contribution and recognized that static friction increases with the length of time an object sits at rest.  Although <xref ref="bib-friction-armstrong" /> indicates that Arthur Morin distinguished static friction from rolling friction in 1833, <xref ref="bib-friction-popov2017" /> indicates that Morin and Dupuit<fn>I can't find information about who Dupuit is.</fn> had a public argument in 1841-1842 about whether Morin's expectation that rolling friction depended on the inverse of the wheel-radius (consistent with earlier work by Coulomb) or Dupuit's expectation that rolling friction depended on the inverse of the square root of the wheel-radius.  <xref ref="bib-friction-popov2017" /> also indicates that both are mostly correct, but under different conditions.  <xref ref="bib-friction-kerr2014" /> indicates that this dispute was described by Tabor in 1962<fn>Google-documents did not provide that reference page, but I did find <url href="https://www.smf.phy.cam.ac.uk/files/Taborpublications.pdf" /> which lists:  Tabor, D. <q>Introductory remarks</q>, in <q>Rolling Contact Phenomena</q>, pp. 1-5, publ.

                                        If you are sitting in the swing and take hold of the chains at about shoulder height, you should be able to shake them in (towards your chest) and out (away from you, towards your neighbor swings).  You can do this same motion while standing next to the swing.  If you do this when the swing is empty, it is very easy to do this.  If you ask a series of successively larger people to sit in the swing, you will notice that it gets progressively more difficult to extend them very far.  The chains are increasing in tension; they are pulled more taut.

If you have ever installed a fan in your house, then you will notice that you have to support the fan while the wires are connected.  Usually the fan has a shaft that connects to the ceiling at one end and the fan at the other and provides a mechanism for supporting the fan while you manage the wires, which pass through the shaft.  Since the fan houses the motor, it is usually reasonably heavy.   The nice property of use a metal shaft to support the fan is that it doesn't stretch or wiggle like a chain might.  The difficulty in this example is that it is more difficulty to notice the tension in the shaft.  If you are the person hanging the fan, then one thing you might be able to notice is that if you flick the metal with a finger when it is not supporting anything, it will have a slightly different <q>ting</q> than when it is supporting the fan.</p>

                <p>When considering the tension in the rope, the context is generally that the rope is connecting two objects that are trying to pull on each other.  It is convenient to recognize that each object only <q>sees</q> the rope, not the object at the far side.  This can be seen in a couple of contexts.</p>

As your understanding improves, we will add some examples where the tension in the rope also affects the rope itself.  In that more complicated situation, the tension will change across the rope and the rope may stretch.  Since ropes and cables are twisted strands while chains are links, ropes and cables can also introduce a <xref ref="s-torsion" text="title">torsion</xref> that tends not to occur in chains.</p>

                        <p>Ropes and chains (and beams) can use tension to support (from above) dangling objects.</p>

                        <example xml:id="se-purse">
                                <title>Tension supports hanging objects</title>

                                </statement>
                                <hint><p>Since the strap supports the purse, what does the strap support against?</p></hint>
                                <hint><p>If we assume the purse is hanging peacefully, then it is not accelerating.  Is there an equation that relates forces to accelerations?</p></hint>
                                <solution>
                                        <p>The strap connects the hook to the purse.  We can consider the interaction between the hook and the strap or between the purse and the strap.  We will consider the latter since we don't know anything about the hook.</p>
                                        <p>Considering the forces on the purse, we know that there is a downwards gravitational force of <m>\deq F_g = (1.36\unit{kg})(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}) = \sig{13.3}{4}{N}</m> and that the net force must zero (because the purse is not accelerating). So, the strap must provide an upwards (tension) force.
                                        <md>
                                        <mrow> \vec F_T + \vec F_g \amp = m \cancelto{0}{\vec a} </mrow>
                                        <mrow>\vec F_T + (-\sig{13.3}{4}{N} \jhat) \amp = 0\unit N </mrow>
                                        <mrow>\vec F_T \amp = +\sig{13.3}{4}{N} \jhat </mrow>
                                        </md>
                                        This is the upwards force that the strap applies to the purse.</p>
                                        <p><alert>Note:</alert> The tension strap is doing two jobs: It is pulling up on the purse (as indicated above) <em>and</em> it is pulling down on the hook.</p>
                                </solution>
                        </example>

                        <p>The important thing to take away from <xref ref="se-purse" text="type-global" /> is not that we can compute the value (although that is, of course, a useful skill), but rather that
                        </p>
                        <insight><p>the tension is conveying the force between the two objects.</p></insight>
                        <p>In the same way that the <xref ref="s-FN" text="title">normal force</xref> on a scale does not measure your weight, but rather the amount you press into the scale, the tension passes force on to the attached object.  The hook doesn't feel the weight of the purse, but does feel the tension required to support the purse.</p>

                        <p>In <xref ref="sss-multiple-mass" text="title">an upcoming section</xref>, we will consider what happens when multiple masses are hung from the rope.</p>

                <p xml:id="d-rope-net">We can also consider the tension in a rope used to drag an object across the floor.  You may recall that in <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> (and the updated version, <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" />) \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> pulled a box across a sheet of ice.  It is possible that  \studentB\ was grabbing the object itself, but it is more likely that \heB\ was pulling on a rope that was attached to the object.  In that case, the tension in the rope was <m>4.0 \unit N</m>.  This tension is what pulled \studentB\ leftwards <em>and</em> what pulled the object rightwards.</p>

                <p>We can further update this by considering the case where \studentB\ pulls the rope up at an angle.  In that case, some of the tension is used to drag the box and some is used to reduce the normal force.  In <xref ref="f-firstFBDangle" text="type-global" />, we will have \studentA\ continue to push with <m>5.0\unit{N}</m> horizontally and have \studentB\ pull with <m>4.0\unit{N}</m> at a <m>14^\circ</m> angle above the horizontal.  You should note that since the tension on the object is pulling up, helping the normal force, this allows the normal force on the object (what a scale would read) to be a little smaller. You should also note that since the tension on \studentB\ is pulling down, counter-acting the normal force, this requires the normal force on \studentB\ (what a scale would read) to be a little larger.</p>

The description is the same as it was for <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="title" /> except that \studentB\ pulls at a slight angle upwards.  We will again need the gravitational force for \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> (<xref ref="se-weightA" text="type-global" />) and \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> (<xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />).

                <p>While the flexibility of ropes makes them inconvenient for pushing, their flexibility makes them <em>very useful</em> for changing the direction of the pull.  The mechanism for changing the direction is the pulley.  Furthermore, by allowing us to change the direction of the pull, we are also able to double, triple, or further improve the strength of the pull.  The term for this is <term>the mechanical advantage</term> of a pulley-system.</p>

                <p>First we will consider three simple cases of redirecting the force.  In each of these cases, I will <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">assume</xref> that the pulley and rope have no mass and that there is no friction in the turning of the pulley (assume it is trivially easy to spin).  If we do not make this assumption, then the problem gets significantly more complicated.</p><todo>add a reference to the section (problem?) where this is considered.</todo>

                                <p>Since the mass is in equilibrium, the net force is zero and the tension must balance the weight.  This tells us that the tension in the rope is <m>20 \unit N</m>.</p>

                                <p>If the pulley were difficult to turn (had friction) that stickiness could help support the mass and the tension on \studentA's side might be less than <m>20\unit N</m>;<fn xml:id="fn-pulley-friction">There is no way (at this point in the conversation) to determine how much the stickiness of a pulley with friction would support.  This would be related to both the coefficient of friction between the pulley and its axis and the coefficient of friction between the rope and the pulley.</fn> but since we assumed the pulley to be frictionless, \studentA\ must provide the full <m>20\unit N</m> of tension to the rope.</p>
                        </solution>
                </example>

                <p>The interesting aspect is that \studentA\ must pull <em>down</em> in order to produce the <em>upward</em> tension on the box.  This means that both \studentA\ and the mass are pulling down.  Since the rope is draped over the pulley, the pulley feels <m>40\unit N</m> downwards, <m>20\unit N</m> from the tension supporting the mass and <m>20\unit N</m> from \studentA\ who is creating the tension that supports the mass.  This means that the second rope that is connecting the pulley to the ceiling must be supporting the full <m>40\unit N</m> in order to keep the pulley in equilibrium.</p>

                        <p>The answer to this depends on how complicated you want the answer to be (recall the discussion about effective theories in <xref ref="s-effective2" text="type-global" />).  Some reasonable answers are:
                        <ul>
                        <li><p> If the rope is static (whether massive or massless), then the net force on the rope must be zero even while it maintains the tension.  </p></li>
                        <li><p> If the rope is accelerating (and massive), the net force on the rope while it transfers the forces between the objects at each end is whatever is necessary to produce the acceleration <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m_\mathrm{rope} \vec a_\mathrm{rope}</m>. In English, you have to drag the rope as well as the sled to which it is attached.</p></li>
                        <li><p> If we assume that the mass of the rope is small enough (<term>insignificant</term>) then whether it is in equilibrium or accelerating, it does not require a net force and it merely passes its tension through to the object at the other end.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        On the other hand, if the rope has mass, then the answer is a different interesting complication, which you can read about in <xref ref="sss-massive-rope" text="type-global" />.  In this case, the tension through the rope changes from one end to the other unless it is not supporting its own weight against gravity (which, unlike other forces, pulls on each portion of the rope) and is static (has no net force).

        <p>The term <q>an applied force</q> is used to describe any force applied by any object when there isn't really a formula to find it.  So this is kind of a <q>any other force</q> category.  I will use this type of force to describe forces exerted by people.  We have seen some examples where a person throws an object.  We can now revisit those examples and consider the force exerted (applied) by the person who threw the object.</p>

        <example xml:id="se-throw-up"><title>Applying a force to throw a ball</title>

Recall that <xref ref="se-ceiling" text="type-global" /> found the normal force by the ceiling on the ball.

                                        When a ball is thrown there are five distinct stages because the forces on the ball change and we can, at this point, only manage to describe a situation in which the forces do not change.

                        <p>During each step, we have the actual acceleration, which tells us about the net force.  We will also need to know the weight of the baseball <m>F_g=\sig{1.42}{2}{N}</m>, because gravity is still acting during the collision.  Let's consider the throwing part first.

                        You can see that the upward applied force <m>(\sig{5.04}{7}{N})</m> has to be large enough so that when it is combined with the downward gravitational force <m>(\sig{1.42}{2}{N})</m> they can together result in the necessary (but smaller) upward net force <m>(\sig{3.62}{5}{N})</m> to get it going upwards.</p>

                        <p>For the catching part, the ball is moving downwards and needs to be stopped, so the catching applied force must be upwards.

        <p>The chapters in this Part touch on the topics that are usually referred to as <q>modern physics</q>.  The goal with including these chapters is to provide
        some inspiration for what some students see as the tedium of the standard material.  These chapters will be linked to throughout
        the book as examples of how the traditional material supports the material that may be in the news and is more talked about in

                <p>The bright, shiny sun, which keeps us all alive, is a nice example of a rather complex system that allows us to verify our various theories of the world around us.

        <introduction>
        <p>This textbook has five characters who follow you throughout the book.  They appear in the examples and some homework problems.  They also remember previous experiences.  I need to adjust the examples in <xref ref="c-force" text="type-hybrid" /> such that the people pushing boxes are helping the reader rearrange furniture.</p>

        <p>The index lists the pages that the characters appear.  The point of this chapter is to highlight some of the primary adventures of the characters according to their own perspectives.  <em>None of the links in this chapter will be given a corresponding return link.</em>  This chapter is for me to track relationships and will likely go away when the book is ready for publication</p>
        <todo>The index will recognize the people in two different formats.  One is by my name for them, which is \studentX (where X is A, B, C, D, ... Z).  The other is by the name assigned to that variable.  So these show up in different places in the Index.</todo>

        <p>I can, at the header of the code, define the name, gender, mass, and dimensions of each individual.</p>

                <p>This will be a dramatic story of college students in and out of relationships, stress about their major, and interacting with parents.  Maybe some travel; certainly some growth.  During their adventure, they casually interact with the reader in unimportant ways that produce the examples and explorations.</p>

                <p>The next set of sections are there to help me storyboard the interactions.</p>
