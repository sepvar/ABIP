        <p>This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in introductory algebra-based physics. </p>

        <p>The purpose of creating this book is to make better use of the technology that electronic texts allow for without losing the
        functionality of a print book.  While this text should be comparable to any other print text, when this is provided in the online
        format it will provide links back and forth between early and later topics.  Linking from later material to earlier material will
        allow students to refresh their memory of what was previously discussed.  Linking from earlier material to later material will
        inspire students to look ahead to how that topic will be used in more interesting scenarios. </p>

        <p>Having these links will allow for some other interesting features that can be placed in the back of the book and accessed
        through links.  Examples of this might be:
        <ol>
            <li><p> <q>Dig Deeper</q> where some of the more tedious and some of the more interesting aspects can be investigated. For
            example in <xref ref="c-motion"  /> on the equations of motion, one might see how these equations are direct applications of calculus
            for those students who happen to have taken that course (which is common for biology and pre-medical students). </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Every Equation Tells a Story</q> which discusses how the description-in-English and the description-with-math
            interrelate to build intuition in both directions. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Examples</q>, with the difference from a traditional textbook being that students can interact with the example as:
            <q>If you have this question, then go here. If you have that question, then go there.</q> </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>In the <lsq/>Real World<rsq/></q> where students see how the concept lives in the messy real world and why
            physicists simplify or ignore complicating aspects. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Connections</q>, which might take one of three forms:
            <ol>
                <li><p> <q>Where have I seen this before?</q> (linking back to earlier material) </p></li>

                <li><p> <q>When will I ever use this?</q> (linking ahead to later material) </p></li>

                <li><p> <q>Why is this interesting?</q> (linking to popular or complex topics)</p></li>
            </ol></p></li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <todo>storyboard the characters and how they develop</todo>
        <p>The goal of the book is to encourage curiosity in the reader. Since there is an expectation that students will explore the
        material on their own, advanced topics will explicitly note where the reader can look for supporting material and basic topics will
        be motivated with links to more advanced topics.  To help maintain the interest of the reader, recurring characters will be
        featured in the examples.  These characters will live a storyline and
        interact with each other.  It is possible to read the examples as a separate storyline for the N interacting characters. </p>
        <todo>Decide how many characters</todo>

        <p>I am choosing the approach described above based on the assumption that students will prefer to develop their knowledge by
        building a world-view that connects to their current understanding, their interests, and their world-view. Providing the
        cross-referencing links without distracting students with all of the information at once will enable them to explore the
        information. Writing the text in a narrative style that helps students see the explanations for the world they live in will
        encourage them to explore <q>what happens when I do this</q> in their real life. Fostering this spirit of exploration will enable
        the instructors to bring their own active-learning techniques into the classroom. </p>

        <todo><em>Book Layout:</em> Here we should add information about Adventures, Examples, Equation-Stories, and IRLs.</todo>
        <p>This textbook is in several Parts:  <em><xref ref="P-prerequisites"  text="type-global" /></em> is for the preliminaries, including descriptions of science in general, physics in
        particular, and the use of math.  <em><xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> is intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar.  <em><xref ref="P-UsingMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> develops the
        ideas in <xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /> by introducing momentum, circular motion, rotational motion, torque, and the Newtonian theory of gravitation.
        <em><xref ref="P-oscillations">Parts</xref> and <xref ref="P-thermodynamics" text="global"/></em>  are oscillations and thermodynamics.  With the traditional organization of the two-semester
        introductory physics, these parts can be covered in either order and can be chosen to be put in either semester. <em><xref ref="P-EandM"  text="type-global" /></em>
        covers electricity, magnetism, light, and optics.  This is traditionally the meat of the second semester. <em><xref ref="P-modern"  text="type-global" /></em>
        touches on the topics that are usually referred to as <q>modern physics</q>.  The goal with including these chapters is to provide
        some inspiration for what some students see as the tedium of the standard material.  These chapters will be linked to throughout
        the book as examples of how the traditional material supports the material that may be in the news and is more talked about in
        popular science.  The last final part, <em><xref ref="P-supplements"  text="type-global" /></em>, holds the answers to the interactive examples mentioned above, the bulk
        of the adventures the reader can investigate in order to test their understanding of the material, and the story lines of each of
        the characters in the text. </p>

        <introduction>
        <p>Once upon a time somebody saw the world around them and thought something equivalent to <q>well, that's an interesting pattern<ellipsis /></q> and predictions were born.  Every human and many animals build their own world of expectations such as: objects will fall down, food will arrive at mealtime, or certain people will smile at me.  Scientists study the patterns in the world around us and do so in a fairly specific way.  Novelists, sociologists, historians, and cartoonists also look at the world around us in a very particular way.  The story of humanity is a story about observing the world around us.</p>

        <p>Scientists, in general, observe patterns through careful, detailed measurements <ellipsis /></p>

        <p>Physicists, in particular, consider the patterns in the physical world around us.</p>
        <todo>Add description of physics</todo>

        <paragraphs xml:id="d-physicspatterns"><p>Some patterns that you might experience help us take very different experiences and group them together.  For example, there are ways in which <xref ref="d-freefall">dropping your keys</xref> and <xref ref="d-ballistic">throwing a dog toy</xref> are very similar.  They both fall, even thought the fall along rather different paths.  There are also patterns that you experience that might look very similar but can be treated very differently.  For example, the path of baseball pitch (See <xref ref="irl-nonparabolic"  text="type-global" />.) is very different for a fast ball compared to a slider, a curve ball, or a knuckleball.</p></paragraphs>

        <!-- \new{v2.1}{Filled in the details a little.} -->
        <todo>This chapter should mirror <xref ref="c-revisted"  text="type-global" /></todo>

        <introduction>
        <p>What you will find in this book is a series of chapters that, on the surface, feel like a list of isolated topics.  Each chapter will have examples that focus your attention on examples of that specific concept.  However, the really interesting aspect of physics is that these descriptions of the world around us come together in different ways to explain complex systems that might feel unrelated.  For example, the thermodynamics of making your refrigerator work on Earth comes from the same theories of thermodynamics that help us understand the heat flow of the sun.  Furthermore, in order to understand the sun, we also need to understand the gravitational interaction, which also describes how baseballs fly through the air.</p>

        <p>This chapter will introduce a set of quick-overview explanations of phenomena to indicate how different ideas tie together in some complex systems.  The point  is specifically to over-simplify complex ideas in order to <q>get the idea</q>.  You will also be pointed to the various chapters that go into the details of the relevant physics where you can learn more.  Then, at the end of the book in <xref ref="c-revisted"  text="type-global" />, we will revisit each of these ideas and go into the description in more depth assuming you have understood each of the relevant chapters, with reference back to the sections that provide the basis of our understanding.</p>

                <warning> <p>Since this particular chapter is intended to be background introduction, rather than a place to study details, none of the links to other sections here will have return links in the rest of the text.  So, if you intend to use this as a jumping off point, you might want to create a bookmark here so that you can return after you read the details in other sections.</p></warning>

                <p>In the early ages of the universe, which is an entirely different story that could be told, there were a ridiculously large number of particles created and drifting around.  There were a variety of types (<xref ref="ss-StandardModel"  text="type-global" />), some being positively charged (<xref ref="s-Echarge"  text="type-global" />), some negatively charged, and some were neutral; but the larger ones tended to gradually decay (<xref ref="ss-particledecay"  text="type-global" />) into smaller ones.  The smaller of the positively-charged baryons (<xref ref="s-particle"  text="type-global" />), which we call protons, and the smallest of the negatively-charged leptons (<xref ref="s-particle"  text="type-global" />), which we call electrons, also tended to stick together because of their electrical charges (<xref ref="s-Echarge"  text="type-global" />), forming hydrogen atoms.  You may note that as this happens, sometimes the more ambitious of the particles form larger clumps of two protons and two neutrons, making helium atoms that are held together by the strong nuclear force ([need ref])</p>

                        <p>The bright, shiny sun, which keeps us all alive, is a nice example of a rather complex system that allows us to verify our various theories of the world around us.  As an over-simplification of the process, we can consider the existence of a star in three phases: the ignition (some have said <q>birth</q>) of a star, the shining (some would say <q>life</q>) of the star, and the snuffing (<q>death</q>?) of the star.</p>

        <todo>Should this be here or in <xref ref="s-effective2"  text="type-global" />?</todo>

        <p>All of our explanations are approximations.  This section will describe some physics in the world around us in one or two paragraphs with links to the sections in the book that provide the detailed understanding of that piece which connects to the mathematics and the underlying foundation.  Each topic will also link to a more detailed discussion at the end of the book with a longer conversation that gets into more nitty-gritty details which assume you have learned the details from the book.  In short, this section looks forward to what is possible to understand and that chapter looks back at how you do understand.  Each of these topics will also be accompanied by a five-minute podcast describing the topic.</p>

        <p>The term <q>effective theory</q> is used in physics to describe a wide-reaching phenomenon which can be approximated by a simpler theory in a smaller circumstance.  So, for example, Einstein's theory of general relativity as a complex description of the gravitational interaction.  It would be unwieldy and impractical to use that to describe our day-to-day interactions with the gravitational interaction.  On the other hand, Newton's theory of the gravitational interaction is a special case of Einstein's general theory of relativity that works perfectly well so long as you behave yourself and do not try to travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light.  We can say that Newton's theory of gravity is an effective theory for Einstein's theory of gravity that accounts for acceleration at low speeds.  Likewise, Einstein's special theory of relativity is an effective theory of the general theory of relativity.  The special theory is relevant when you do not allow for acceleration, but do allow for faster speeds.  Once you reach beyond the limitations of the effective theory, the description <q>breaks down</q>.</p>

        <p>For example, see <xref ref="p-g-to-3-digits" text="title">the discussion on the acceleration due to gravity being <q>locally constant</q></xref>.</p>

        <introduction>
        <p>Mathematics is its own language.  It is the language of patterns.  Humans are very adept at tracking patterns.  Physics is the study of patterns in the physical world.  It turns out that the language of physics provides a natural and concise mechanism for expressing patterns in a uniquely precise manner.</p>

For example, the equation for thermal conductivity, <xref ref="eq-thermalconductivity"  text="type-global" /> in <xref ref="ss-thermalconductivity"  text="type-global" />, allows \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> to predict the time it takes for \hisA\ oven to warm up to a specific temperature because <m>\displaystyle \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \kappa A \, \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}</m> says that {the rate at which energy flows} {depends on} {how well air allows energy to flow,} {the size of the oven,} and {the amount the temperature needs to change} {across the height of the oven} as follows:</p>

                <introduction>
                <p>The International System of Units (SI) <xref ref="biblio-wiki-SI" /> was adopted in 1960 at the
                <url href="http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=11">eleventh meeting</url>
                of the
                <url href="http://www.bipm.org/en/about-us/">International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)</url>.
                <fn xml:id="fn-BIPM">In French this organization is the Bureau International des poids et mesures, so the acronym is BIPM.</fn>
                </p>

                <p>In 1901 at the
                <url href="http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ListCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=3">third meeting</url>
                of the BIPM, it
                <url href="http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/3/2/">was declared</url>
                that
                        <ol>
                                <li><p> The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram;</p></li>
                                <li><p> The word <q>weight</q> denotes a quantity of the same nature as a <q>force</q>: the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity; in particular, the standard weight of a body is the product of its mass and the standard acceleration due to gravity;</p></li>
                                <li><p> The value adopted in the International Service of Weights and Measures for the standard acceleration due to gravity is <m>980.665 \unitfrac{cm}{s^2}</m>, value already stated in the laws of some countries.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                Other related decisions were made at the following meetings:
                        <ol>
                                <li><p> The 11th meeting (1960) redefined the meter in terms of wavelengths of light.</p></li>
                                <li><p> The 13th meeting (1967) redefined the second in terms of the frequency of radiation from <m>^{133}</m>Cs.</p></li>
                                <li><p> The 17th meeting (1983) redefined the meter in terms of the speed of light and seconds.</p></li>
                                <li><p> The 24th (2011) and 25th (2014) meeting discussed redefining the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant, with an expectation that it will be redefined at the 26th meeting (Nov, 2018).  See note in <xref ref="ss-units"  text="type-global" />.</p></li>

        <idx>Precision</idx>
        <!-- \new{v2.2}{Added section, added some detail} -->

        <p>In this section, we will consider the benefits of being precise both in measurements and in our language.  Sometimes people confuse the words precise and accurate, but they mean different things.  It may help to remember that the opposite of precise is vague.  Being precise makes it easier to determine if a statement is accurate.  If we already know the answer, then we can know if a result is accurate.  However, the exciting aspect of science is to study that which we do not already know.  In this case, gauging accuracy can be tricky.  If we are do not already know an answer, then we can try to be consistent within our accepted precision.</p>

        <p>Since physics has its roots in the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks and developed mathematically with Galileo and Newton, it has been around long enough for the technical language to both evolve (Newton used the word <q>action</q> for what we refer to as <q>force</q>) and to be absorbed into everyday (colloquial) language. Words like force and energy have taken on broader meanings in English.  In this text, we will try to be precise with the language.  Hopefully we can avoid using the dismissive phrase, <q>Oh, you <em>know</em> what I <em>mean</em>.</q></p>

        <p xml:id="p-massive">One example of not being careful with the language comes when people use the term <q>massive</q> to mean <q>big.</q>  The word massive actually means <q>has a large amount of material</q> whereas big means <q>takes up a large amount of space</q> (which might be replaced by the word <q>voluminous</q> rather than <q>massive</q>). These are related by <xref ref="s-density">the density</xref><idx>Density</idx> but it is possible to be massive and not voluminous (see, for example, the discussion of <xref ref="sss-blackhole2">black holes</xref>).  While it is <em></em>technically} inaccurate to use massive to mean big, <q>we</q> know what <q>we</q> mean.</p>

        <p>A short Google<trademark /> search by the author found that the conversation rate between pounds and kilograms was
        <m>1 \unit{kg} = 2.2046226218 \unit{lbs}</m>.  Several sites go on to list about 10 decimal places for all of the conversions.  First, you should recall our discussion about <xref ref="s-sigfig" text="title">significant digits</xref><idx>Significant Digits</idx>.
        <!-- \new{v2.2}{moved this conversation here.} -->
        Second you should note that the unit of pounds is a measure of force (how much the Earth pulls on you)<idx>Weight</idx>, whereas the unit of kilogram is a measure of mass (how much <q>stuff</q> there is)<idx>Mass</idx>.  These are related in proportion to the strength of the gravitational field, which varies in the third digit (on the order of about 1<percent />) around the globe.  Some sites indicate that they are shortening their conversion factor to 3 digits for convenience, but this is not an issue of convenience, it is an issue of precision<idx>Precision</idx>.</p>

        <p>Life is complicated.  One mechanism that scientists in general and physicists in particular use to simplify their descriptions of the world around us is to build an effective theory.  These are not intended to be true (accurate) to as many decimal places as can be calculated, but rather are intended to be good enough.  In this context, good enough is most likely to mean something like: true to a reasonable number of decimal places.</p>

        <p>A colloquial example of this is when you wear a smile to give the impression of happiness even if you are not in the mood.  Most of your casual interactions will be the same as when you are in a good mood, but your friends who know you better will recognize the small discrepancies.</p>

        <p>A technical example of this is that Newton's theory of gravity is very precise as long as none of the objects being described are travelling <q>close</q> to the speed of light.  How close counts as close depends on the level of precision the measurement needs to be.  If any of the objects are moving close to the speed of light, then we need Einstein's general theory of relativity.  One way to describe this is that Newton's theory is a special case of Einstein's Theory.  Another way is describe it is that Newton's theory is an effective theory for Einstein's theory, effective when the speed is low.  It is possible for us to measure the difference between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory, but it is often not worth the effort of using the more complex theory in the cases where the simpler one will do; it is effectively true (rather than actually true).</p>

        <p>Another technical example is that Einstein's special theory of relativity is a special case of the general theory of relativity.  The aspect that makes it a special case is that the special theory only considers motion without acceleration.</p>

        <p>One final case that should be mentioned up front is to notice that humans experience the Earth <em>as if</em> it were stationary.</p>
        <todo><p>Decide if this should be filled out more or if it should reference the variety of places where the text fills out these kinds of details.</p></todo>

        <p>Sometimes we imagine objects to be <q>massless</q> or <q>frictionless</q>.  In these instances we <em>usually</em> mean that the mass (or amount of friction) is small enough to not impact the significant digits of our calculation.  In those cases, if we consider a more-precise measurement/computation, then the mass (or amount of friction) would impact the significant digits.

<part xml:id="P-IntroMFE"><title>Introducing Motion, Force, and Energy</title>
        <introduction>
        <p>The chapters in this Part are intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar. </p>

        <p>The trio of topics in this part of the book are fundamental and powerful concepts<fn xml:id="f-FPC">The idea of Fundamental and Powerful Concepts (F&amp;PC) is taken from Dr. Gerald Nosich, <em>Learning to Think Things Through</em>, Prentice Hall, 2012.</fn>.  These are fundamental in that most other topics in physics are built upon them.  They are powerful in that if they are well-understood, then one is empowered to use them to understand and develop an intuition for nearly any other topic that is experienced.  It has been my experience that with these topics, students can jump into a surprisingly wide variety of other, significantly more esoteric, topics and develop a reasonable grasp of the key concepts.  Furthermore, the development of understanding of these ideas introduce the language and thought processes of being a professional physicist such that it nicely bridges the language barrier that might otherwise exist due to the jargon of physics.</p>

                <p>Identifying the position requires identifying a common known position (which we could call <q>the origin</q>), a distance from that known location (which we could call <q>a magnitude</q>), and a direction from the origin in which to travel such a distance.

                <p>Position can be seen to be a vector when you describe a meeting place or destination to a friend who has never been to that location:  <q>Well, you know where the bookstore is, right?</q> (establishes a common origin).  <q>OK, so, if you face the sports gear shop<ellipsis /></q> (sets the coordinate axis and defines the position direction) <q><ellipsis /> turn left and walk a block</q> (defines the magnitude and the direction).</p>

                <p xml:id="d-freefall">Since acceleration is the change in velocity (magnitude and/or direction), it is possible to select your own rate of change while driving your car.  However, that acceleration is difficult to measure directly.  Your speedometer measures the speed and you have to compute your acceleration based on how quickly your speed changes.  It turns out that there is a convenient way to start from the acceleration and compute the expected velocity:  Drop a ball or your keys.  To convince yourself that objects do, in fact, accelerate when they fall, we can consider dropping items.  One of the complications during such an experiment will be discussed in <xref ref="ss-airresistance" text="type-global" />.  If we drop a sheet of paper, air resistance causes an obvious effect (fluttering).  For this section, I will assume that the mass-to-surface-area ratio is large enough that we can <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effectively</xref> ignore the air resistance.</p>

It turns out that the air resistance is fairly complicated, but in the case of baseballs, the part that is relevant is that air resistance is strong when the ball is moving faster and weak when the ball is moving slower.  (This is different than the surface friction you will see in <xref ref="s-Ff" text="type-global"/>.)  The effect of this is that the ball (usually) looks like it travels up into the air on a fairly straight path with a slight bend, which would produce a very wide parabola.  As it slows, the horizontal motion decreases, which tightens the parabola.  By the time the ball gets to its highest point, it is often travelling fairly slowly and has mostly all vertical motion by the time it drops into the outfielder's glove.</p></solution>

As the ball rolls out of the pitcher's hand, a spin is (usually) given to the ball and this spin interacts with the air to modify the direction that the air presses on the ball during the flight.  This will slightly affect the flight of the ball during the time it takes for the ball to get from the pitcher's mound to home plate.  In addition, fast balls have less time for the gravitational force to pull the ball down, so they will curve downwards less than a slower pitch.  This makes following the path of the ball somewhat difficult, but with some practice and careful attention, you should be able to see it.  All balls will drop somewhat, but the effect of the air resistance is exactly the mechanism for making a pitch unpredictable, so it is unlikely that you see the ball drop in a clean parabolic path.</p></solution>

        <p>Sometimes we care about the thing doing the pushing or pulling, sometimes we don't.  We always care about the thing being pushed or pulled.  We will <em>distinguish these objects</em> by referring to the object that is pushing as the object <q>causing the force</q> or <q>exerting the force</q> and by referring to the object that is being pushed as the object <q>feeling the force</q>.  We will <em>distinguish these forces</em> as follows:

                <description>Use of subscripts on force labels: If it is obvious which object feels the force, the the subscript will only indicate <em>which force</em>.
                        If it is not obvious which object feels the force, the the subscript will also indicate which object the force is acted <em>on</em>.
                        Sometimes we need to clarify who exerts the force as well as who feels the force.  In this case, the subscripts indicate who the force is <em>on</em>, who the force is <em>by</em>, and which force we are referring to: <m>F_\mathrm{on, by, type}</m>.
                        </description>
                </notation>
                The notation for this will be <m>F_{A,B}</m> where the first subscript is the person who felt the force (who the force is <q>on</q>) and the second subscript is who exerted the force (who the force is <q>by</q>).  In those instances when we only care about who is feeling the force and not who is exerting the force, we might just use one subscript <m>F_A</m>.  In some cases, there may be two forces acting on one person (or object).  In that case, it will be obvious who is feeling the force and we will use the subscript to distinguish which force it is, such as <m>F_1</m> or <m>F_2</m>, rather than who feels the force.</p>
                </convention>
        This will be more relevant when we discuss in <xref ref="c-forcetype" text="type-global"/> the types of forces that might be applied.</p>

        <introduction>
        <p xml:id="sum-NewtonsLaws">Newton's Laws (recall <xref ref="s-law" text="title">Theory versus Law</xref>) describe our observations about three questions:
        <ol>
                <li><p> What happens to an object when I <em>don't</em> push on it?</p></li>
                <li><p> What happens <em>to an object</em> when I do push on it?</p></li>
                <li><p> What happens <em>to me</em> when I push on an object?</p></li>
        </ol>
        The answer to these questions have a precise, concise, technical language and the point of the next three subsections are to translate that into (modern) English, into math, and into intuition.  The statement of these laws has slightly different versions in different texts to emphasize different points.  We will state them as follows<idx><h>Newton</h><h>Laws</h></idx><idx><h>Laws</h><h>Newton</h></idx>:
        <ol>
                <li><p>When viewed from an inertial reference frame, an object with no forces acting on it will maintain its velocity, which may be zero.</p></li>
                <li><p> When viewed from an inertial reference frame, the vector-sum of all forces acting on an object will cause that object to accelerate in proportion to its mass: <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m \vec a</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p> For every force acting (the <q>action</q>) on one object by an other object, there is an equal-in-magnitude reaction-force acting on the other object in the opposite direction.</p></li>
        </ol></p>

        <todo>Make this <q>recall</q> a pop-up, not a parenthetical, by linking to paragraph, not a section</todo>
        <p xml:id="d-NewtonInertial">There are a few terms that should be clarified in these laws.  Being in an inertial <xref ref="d-referenceframe" text="title">reference frame</xref><idx><h>Reference Frames</h><h>Inertial</h></idx> essentially means being in a place in which you do not have to hold on in order to maintain your position.  If you are <xref ref="s-acceleration" text="title">accelerating</xref> (recall that this means <em>speeding up</em>, <em>slowing down</em>, or <em>changing direction</em>) then you are not in an inertial reference frame, but rather are in a non-inertial reference frame.  In this case, you will misinterpret the forces acting.  This will be discussed in more detail in <xref ref="s-noninertial" text="type-global" /> when we discuss centripetal force and in <xref ref="ss-coriolis" text="type-global" /> when we discuss the Coriolis effect.</p>

        <p xml:id="d-objectinmotion">Sometimes Newton's first law is written to include the phrase <q>an object in motion</q>, which I will be careful to link directly to <xref ref="d-motion" text="title">velocity</xref>, as was done above.  However, it technically should reference the momentum, which is discussed in <xref ref="c-momentum" text="type-global" />.</p>

        <p>The way Newton's third law is often written and referred to includes the words <q>action</q> and <q>reaction</q>.  Newton was referring to forces with these words and to keep it clear in our discussion, we will use the word force, with the occasional clarification of the action-force or the reaction-force.</p>

                <p>Let's take this apart and connect it to your daily experiences.  Looking ahead, we will discuss the surface of the Earth as a <xref ref="d-noninertial">non-inertial rotating reference frame</xref>; however, the effect is small enough that for most of what we <xref ref="d-casual" text="title">casually observe</xref>, we can safely pretend that the Earth is stationary and that we are actually at rest while sitting on the curb watching the world go by.  This is so true that our human brains already interpret everything around us as though it were an inertial reference frame.  This psychological perspective is exactly the feature that both allows us to make fairly reliable predictions about the world around us <em>and</em> causes us to make incorrect judgements when we encounter non-inertial reference frames.  That is to say, as long as we don't measure our world too closely, we are viewing it from an essentially inertial reference frame.  This point is so implicit, that many books do not even include
                        <fn xml:id="f-newtoninclude">Newton himself did not include it in his original statement.</fn>
                the portion of the statement referring to the reference frame.</p>

                <todo>check the implications of this footnote.</todo>

                <p xml:id="d-atrestinmotion">The rest of this statement is often written a little differently (and less concisely) as <q>an object at rest remains at rest unless acted on by an external force and an object in motion remains in motion unless acted on by an external force.</q>  Since being <xref ref="d-atrest" text="title"><q>at rest</q></xref> is a statement about the velocity<m>(\vec v=0)</m> and being <xref ref="d-motion"><q>in motion</q></xref> is also a statement about the velocity, each of these statements can be understood as saying that
                <assemblage><p>Forces are those things that cause a change in the velocity.</p></assemblage>
                In other words, Newton's first law says that without a force, the velocity will not change.  In the discussion of <xref ref="sss-equilibrium" text="title">equilibrium</xref>, we will note that this is often extended to say that without a <xref ref="sss-netforce" text="title">net force</xref> the velocity will not change, but that is a special case of <xref ref="ss-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref>.</p>

                        <subsubsection xml:id="sss-inertia"><title>Inertia</title><idx>Inertia</idx>

                        <p>This law is often called the <q>law of inertia</q>.  The concept of inertia can be described as <em>the tendency of an object to maintain its velocity</em>.  This is describing how the object behaves when you don't do anything to it.  The inertia is not a quantity that physicists calculate, but physicists do refer to objects as having a lot of inertia, usually to indicate that it will take a large force to change the object's motion, or as having a small amount of inertia, usually to indicate that it should be relatively easy to change the object's motion.  However, the inertia does not actually refer to the force needed.  Instead, the inertia most often refers to the <q>inertial mass</q> of an object, which shows up in the second law.
                                <assemblage><p>Inertia is not a force.</p></assemblage>
                        Sometimes when physicists are not being careful with their language, they will appear to use the word inertia interchangeably with the term <xref ref="c-momentum" text="title">momentum</xref>, which we will discuss in more detail in <xref ref="ss-inertia" text="type-global" />.</p>

                        <p>You should notice that Newton's First Law is about what happens when you are <em>not pushing</em> on the object, which is to say, the tendency of an object to maintain its own motion without a force acting on it; this is the inertia of the object.  On the other hand, Newton's Second Law is about what happens <em>to the object</em> when you <em>do push</em> on an it.  This is what we will consider next.  After that, Newton's third law will describe what happens <em>to the thing pushing</em> rather than just to the thing being pushed.

                <p>Let's take this apart and connect it to your daily experiences.  As with Newton's First Law, the <xref ref="d-noninertial" text="title">non-inertial rotating reference frame</xref> of the surface of the Earth is a small enough effect that, as long as we don't measure our world too closely, we can pretend that we are viewing it essentially from an inertial reference frame.</p>

This also can be expressed as: if the combination of forces, <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net}</m>, do not entirely cancel each other out, then our friend <m>m</m> must be accelerating, <m>\vec a</m>, in a particular direction.  Furthermore the resulting direction of the net force determines the direction of the acceleration.  Connecting the English and the math:</p>

                        <p>This word can be traced back to Latin and Old English with the prefix <em>equi-</em> for <em>equal</em> and the root <em>libra</em> referring to a <em>pair of scales, as in a balance</em>, such as those depicted in images of the astronomical constellation Libra.  When the scales are equal, they are in equilibrium.  Since the second law asks us to calculate the sum of the forces acting on an object, one of the primary questions is to determine if those forces balance each other.  In <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="se-netFsub" text="type-global" />, the forces are not balanced, the object <q>is not in equilibrium</q>, and it will be accelerated in a particular direction.  In the <xref ref="se-equi" text="type-global" />, the forces are balanced, the object <q>is in equilibrium</q>, and it will <em>not change</em> its velocity (in accord with the first law).</p>

                        <p>When forces act on an object, Newton's second law applies, so we usually start with the second law.  If those forces combine to give a net force of zero, such that the object is in equilibrium, then Newton's first law applies.  If we also care about the person or thing pushing, then the third law also applies.</p>

                        <p>To better understand how the first and second laws work together, <xref ref="irl-NI" text="type-global" /> provides some activities that you can do or consider in order to think about the patterns you can see when you are or aren't pushing on objects.  <xref ref="cyoa-NI" text="type-global" /> will help you think through some of the consequences of the first and second law.  When you are ready to solve some problems, you can jump to <xref ref="s-NewtonExamples" text="type-global" />, but some of those examples will also reference Newton's third law.</p>

                <p>For every force acting <em>on</em> one object <em>by</em> an <em>other object</em>, there is an equal-in-magnitude reaction-force acting <em>on</em> the <em>other object</em> in the opposite direction.</p>
                </assemblage>
                <p>This law is often shortened to <q>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</q>  The statement given above is meant to emphasize several points:
                <ul>
                <li><p> These <q>actions</q> are specifically forces.</p></li>
                <li><p> Forces are an interaction in which the acting force is <em>on one object</em> by another and necessitates that there is a reaction force on the other object by the one.  That is to say, an object cannot feel a force without also exerting a force back on the other object.</p></li>
                </ul>
                Another way to say this is that all forces come in action/reaction pairs that necessarily have equal magnitude and opposite direction and necessarily act on different objects.
                </p>
                <aside><title>Foreshadow</title>
                        <p>This law is the force-version of the statement of the <xref ref="s-conservemom" text="title">conservation of momentum</xref>.</p>
                </aside>

                <p xml:id="d-NIIIbracing">Let's take this apart and connect it to your daily experiences.  Students of physics will often see the terms action and reaction and connect it to the way humans react to the actions of their friends.  However, this implies a causal<fn xml:id="causual">Please note that <q>causal</q> and <q>casual</q> are different words.</fn> response that is not true for Newton's forces.  That is to say, this is not a <q>revenge law</q> whereby if you push on me, then I will choose to push you back.  Instead, it is expressing that forces are intrinsically interactions between a pair of objects.  When you push on me, I am -- independent of my choosing to do so -- necessarily pushing back on you.  But, you might say, <q>if that were true, then why am I able to sneak up on you and push you over without falling over myself?</q>  Well, you can think about how that works by reading <xref ref="cyoa-NIII" text="type-global" />. After we introduce the tool of a free-body diagram in the next subsection, you can also explore this idea by comparing <xref ref="ex-braced" text="type-global" /> to <xref ref="ex-unbraced" text="type-global" />.</p>

                        <subsubsection xml:id="sss-FBD"><title>The Free-Body Diagram (FBD)</title>
                        <aside><title>Referenced by</title>

                        <idx>Free-Body Diagrams</idx>

                        <p>In the more interesting situations where there are several forces acting, it can be easy to lose track of what is pushing whom where.  In order to better organize our information and direct our attention, we can make use of <term>free-body diagrams</term>.  The basic idea is to make a diagram for each individual object that we care about in a given situation, and <em>free</em> from the overall picture.  This allows us to identify the forces acting on a single object (relevant for Newton's second law) and more easily pair them with third-law pairs that act on different objects.</p>

                        <p>To see how this works, the next example will build on the previous examples to help us consider not only the (2nd law) forces on the object, but also the (3rd law) forces on the people doing the pushing and pulling.</p>

                        <example xml:id="f-firstFBD">
                                <title>The reaction forces on people pushing a box<idx><h>Free-Body Diagrams</h><h>Images</h></idx></title>
                                <todo>
                                        <p>As before, make this object a desk so that we can have \studentA\ and \studentB\ helping you rearrange your room in your residence hall.  (Change the mass!  But, it is still nice to be moving a small mass so that it has a large acc, and the people have small acc.)</p>
                                </todo>
                                <p>Let's reconsider <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="type-global" />
                                and imagine that \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> stands to the left of the object and exerts a force to the right (pushes) with magnitude <m>\vec F_1 = +5.0\unit{N}\ihat</m> and that \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> stands to the right of the object and exerts a force to the right (pulls) with magnitude <m>\vec F_2 = +4.0\unit{N}\ihat</m>, as drawn in <xref ref="f1-firstFBD" text="type-global" />.  Both of these forces are <em>on</em> the object and, by <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref> cause it to accelerate (as described in <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" />).  <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title">Newton's third law</xref> tells us about the interaction <em>between</em> objects and, from this, we can deduce the force on \studentA\ and \studentB.<fn>It is then separately possible to use <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">the second law</xref> to learn about the motion of the people, as will be shown in <xref ref="se-FBD-AB" text="type-global" />.</fn>
                                </p>

                        <p>As indicated above, the free-body diagram also helps us visualize the third-law (action/reaction) force pairs.  By evaluating the colored forces in <xref ref="f2-firstFBD" text="type-global" /><idx><h>Free-Body Diagrams</h><h>Images</h></idx>, we can see that the <m>\mathrm{\color{green}{green\ forces}}</m> form an action-reaction pair and separately the <m>\mathrm{\color{blue}{blue\ forces}}</m> form an action-reaction pair.

                          <li>The <xref ref="as-NIII" text="title">third law</xref> action-reaction pairs are located of different objects and cannot be added. (You cannot add blue to blue nor green to green.)</li>
                          <li>The <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">second law</xref> forces on the object should be added to find that specific object's acceleration.  (You <em>should</em> add the blue force to the green force on the middle object.)</li>
                        </ol>
                        None of these three are in equilibrium, because they each have a net force.   <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" /> calculates the acceleration of the object. <xref ref="se-FBD-AB" text="type-global" /> calculates the acceleration of the people.</p>

                        <p xml:id="d-FBD-AB">The point of <xref first="f-firstFBD" last="se-FBD-AB" text="global">Examples</xref> in comparison to Examples <xref ref="se-netFadd" text="global" /> (which told us about the forces on the object) and <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="global" /> (which told us about how the object moved) is to highlight the different roles of Newton's second and third laws.  The earlier examples were relevant to the second law and only affected the object itself.  To say this more specifically, the forces within one free-body diagram are described by Newton's second law. They do get added together to form the net-force (which is to say that we can add the object's green force to the object's blue force). They are able to cancel each other if they <em>happen to</em> be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Finally, they will determine how that specific object accelerates.  On the other hand, Newton's third law describes any specific pair of forces that interact between free-body diagrams (each colored pair); they <em>will necessarily be</em> equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, but they cannot be canceled because they cannot be added because they are on different objects.</p>

                <answer xml:id="A-hbf"><p>There are forces acting on it.  You should be able to tell this because you are exerting one of the forces. While it is true that there are forces on it, it is also true that there is no <em>net force</em>.  If you are exerting an upward force on the book, can you guess (<xref ref="A-gravity" text="type-local" />) what the downward force is?   </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-hbnof"><p>It is true that while you hold the book, there is no <em>net force</em>, but that does not mean that there is no force acting.  If there were no forces on the book, then your hand would not need to be there.  In fact, if you remove the force your hand provides, then the book falls. This shows that there is an upward force (by your hand on the book) and a downward force (of gravity by the Earth on the book). </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-true1"><p>It is in equilibrium.  When the acceleration is zero, then the net force must be zero and those properties are what define equilibrium.</p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-false1"><p>The definition of equilibrium is that the forces balance.  The result of this is that the net force must be zero and the acceleration is then zero.  You can tell this is true because the velocity is <em>not changing</em>.  It is not important that the velocity is zero, what is important is that the velocity <em>stays</em> zero.  While you hold it, the book is in equilibrium. </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-falls"><p>Both <q>Yes</q> and <q>No</q> bring you to this answer.  Yes, there is <em>a force</em> on the book while it falls (the force of gravity), but no, there are not force<alert>s</alert> (plural).  There is only one force.  <q>But, wait!</q> you say, <q>What about the force of air resistance?</q>  Aha!   You are correct; there is a force of air resistance, but in this case, it is negligible and we will not consider it.

                <answer xml:id="A-hitN"><p>While it is hitting the desk, the velocity is changing from <q>moving downwards</q> to <q>stopped</q>.  Since the velocity is changing, <em>the book is accelerating</em>.  Since it is accelerating, the book is not in equilibrium.  </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-landedY"><p>It is in equilibrium.  The book is at rest and <em>continues to be</em> at rest on the desk. There are forces acting, but they cancel each other, resulting in no net force. </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-landedN"><p>After it has landed, the book stops moving.  Once the book comes to rest on the desk, it <em>continues to stay at rest</em>.  This says that the velocity is not changing, so the book is not accelerating.  That means that the book is in equilibrium. There are forces acting, but they cancel each other, resulting in no net force. </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-gravity"><p>It is the force of gravity.</p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-zero"><p>Recall the situation when you were holding the book.  Gravity is still pulling the book down and the desk is holding the book up.  There are two forces acting on the book while it is at rest on the desk. </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-one"><p>If there were only one force on the book, it could not be a balanced force, so the book could not be in equilibrium and the book would be accelerating.  The book is not accelerating, so there are either two forces (<xref ref="A-two" text="type-local" />) or no forces (<xref ref="A-zero" text="type-local" />). </p></answer>
                <answer xml:id="A-two"><p>There are two forces acting on the book while it is at rest on the desk. Similar to the situation when you were holding the book, gravity is pulling the book down and the desk is holding the book up. </p></answer>

(Both are trying to change the velocity, but cancel to result in a constant velocity.)  When you stop pushing, the chair stops moving because there is a force from the tile acting to oppose the force you apply while you push the chair; when you let go, this force slows the chair until the chair stops and then the force stops acting.

The reason is that this is <em>how all objects behave; they maintain their velocity when allowed to act without interference.</em> (This is why Newton's first law says what it does.)   Because the chair with wheels has much less friction there is a smaller force trying to interfere with the motion and so it continues to move for a noticeable distance. The other chairs slowed to a stop almost immediately.

The careful way to describe the situation is that your force gave the chair some velocity (actually <xref ref="c-momentum" text="title">momentum</xref>) and its characteristic inertia made it difficult for the <xref ref="s-Ff" text="title">frictional force</xref> to slow it down rapidly.</p></solution>

For the carpet, there is a lot of friction and the chair slows down very quickly (essentially instantaneously).  For the wheel-less chair on the tile floor, the chair slows rapidly although it may leave your hand.  The wheels provide the least amount of friction and that chair goes the furthest.  You may note that the friction slowing the chair-with-wheels is primarily between the rolling wheel and its axel (where it connects to the non-rolling chair leg) rather than between the wheel and the floor (although the friction between the wheel and the floor also plays a role).

On the other hand, if you did continue to push, then the chair would continue to speed up and you would have to run faster and faster to keep up with it.

Like \studentC<idx><h sortby="\studentC">\studentC</h></idx>, \heD\ did not expect it and was not braced, so \heD\ falls over. Similarly, you decided not to brace yourself and in pushing \studentD, you fall over backwards!  \studentD\ did not have to <em>choose</em> to push on you.  The act of you deciding to push \himD\ necessarily and simultaneously produces a force on you, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.  Unfortunately, \studentD\ doesn't think this was a useful exercise and shouts <q>I have the whole thing on video!</q> and storms off to Campus Security.

                                We also know that \studentC\ is not bracing \himselfC\ (because \heC\ <q>has \hisC\ back turned</q>) so \heC\ only feels one force, and that \studentZ\ is bracing \himselfZ\ (because the problem states that \heZ\ <q>leans in</q>) so \heC\ exerts multiple forces.</p>

        <introduction>
        <todo>add reference to the general theory</todo>
        <p>There are many mechanisms for imparting force on an object.  Perhaps the most obvious is that objects fall towards the Earth.  We call this force <q>gravity</q> and we will discuss it first.  It turns out to be somewhat more complicated because it turns out that the force that helps us fall when we trip is the same force that holds the planets in their orbits.  The complicated general theory will be discussed later, but for now <xref ref="s-Fg" text="type-local" /> will describe the phenomenon at the surface of the Earth where we usually experience it.</p>

        <p>After a brief introduction to the four fundamental forces in <xref ref="s-fundamental" text="type-local" />, we will consider the <xref ref="s-FN" text="title">normal force</xref>, <xref ref="s-FT" text="title">tension</xref> (such as in ropes), <xref ref="s-Ff" text="title">friction</xref>, <xref ref="s-springs" text="title">springs</xref>, and end with the catch-all additional category of <xref ref="s-FA" text="title">applied forces</xref>.  <xref ref="s-Fnet" text="type-local" /> will wrap it up by using examples including multiple types of force to compute the net force, which connects back to Newton's Laws in the previous chapter.</p>

                <introduction>
                <p>Perhaps the force that is the most obvious to humanity is the one that helps us fall when we stumble: the gravitational force<idx><h>Gravity</h><h>Surface of Earth</h></idx>.  This is one of the fundamental forces discussed in <xref ref="s-fundamental" text="type-global" />.  In addition, the details about how the planets, moon, and the sun experience this force will be discussed in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global" />.  For now, we can consider how this interaction manifests itself on our daily lives.  In this section, we will start with how objects move when the gravitational force is the only force acting.  Subsections <xref ref="ss-weightmass" text="local" /> and <xref ref="ss-equivmm" text="local" /> will clarify some subtleties and then we'll jump into the examples in <xref ref="ss-local-mg" text="type-local" />.</p>

                <p>We can investigate what happens when the gravitational force is the only force acting on an object by holding it in the air and dropping it<idx>Freefall</idx>.  One of the complications during such an experiment was discussed in <xref ref="ss-airresistance" text="type-hybrid" />.  If we drop a sheet of paper, there is air resistance in addition to the gravitational force.  For this section, I will assume that the mass-to-surface-area ratio is large enough that we can effectively ignore the air resistance.
                <biographical><title>Touchstone</title><p>Recall <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effective theories</xref>.</p></biographical></p>

                <p xml:id="d-Fgrav">Since objects fall faster than humans are used to paying attention to, the patterns are difficult to see.  The green box of <xref ref="irl-freefall" text="type-hybrid" /> shows you how you can pay close attention to the patterns that result from observing falling objects.  You should go do those experiments before reading further.  Go ahead.  I'll wait.</p>

                <p xml:id="d-Fgball">You did do them, right?  You're not just reading ahead?  Really?  OK.  Doing that experiment will help you see (1) that everything falls at the same rate and (2) that objects accelerate as they fall.  This first point is a bit less intuitive and will be discussed further in <xref ref="ss-equivmm" text="type-hybrid" />.  This second point should be exactly what you expect, when you consider <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second Law</xref>: If there is only one force (the gravitational force), then the object cannot be in <xref ref="sss-equilibrium" text="title">equilibrium</xref> and it must be accelerating.  (You should notice that this is the language of <xref ref="st-Fma" text="title">the story of Newton's second law</xref>.)</p>

                <p>In order to evaluate this further, let's consider a specific object, like a baseball.  Our baseball has a mass of <m>m_b = 0.145\unit{kg}</m>.  If the only force acting <em>on</em> the ball is the gravitational force <em>by</em> the Earth, then the net force is the gravitational force: <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = \vec F_{bEg}</m>.
                <biographical><title>Touchstone</title><p><xref ref="d-interaction" text="title">the on-by notation</xref></p></biographical>
                Here the subscripts are <m>b</m> (because the force is on the <em>b</em>all), <m>E</m> (because the force is exerted by the <em>E</em>arth), and <m>g</m> (because it is a <em>g</em>ravitational force).  Since the acceleration is due to the gravitational force, I will use either <m>a_g</m> (usually when the object is in <xref ref="ss-freefall" text="title">freefall</xref> and therefore accelerating at this rate) or <m>g</m> (usually when the object is not actually accelerating at that rate).  With this notation, Newton's second law becomes:
                <me> \vec F_{bEg} = m_b \vec a_g </me>
                At this point, we know the mass, but we don't know the force or the acceleration.  However, we have conveniently already done the experiment (recall <xref ref="ex-freefall" text="type-hybrid"/>) that will tell us the acceleration is <m>a_g = 9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m> downwards.  (Recall that <q>downwards</q> is the direction of the vector, which can be expressed as <m>-\jhat</m>.)  If we know the mass and the acceleration, then we can compute the force.</p>

                <example xml:id="se-weightball">
                        <title>Calculate the weight of a ball in freefall</title>
                        <statement>
                        <p>If a baseball with mass <m>m_b = 0.145\unit{kg}</m> is dropped (allowed to <xref ref="ss-freefall" text="title">fall freely</xref>) so that it accelerates at <m>a_g = 9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}</m> downwards, then while it falls it feels the gravitational force:
                        <me> \vec F_g = m \vec g = (0.145\unit{kg}) [-(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2})\,\jhat] = -\sig{1.42}{24}{N} \jhat = -1.42 \unit N \jhat </me>.
                        </p>
                        </statement>
                </example>

                <p>This is the force of the gravitational force on the baseball.  Although we computed the force while the ball was falling, the gravitational force does not magically vanish when the ball is sitting on the floor.  So, we can say that (as long as the ball is close to the surface of the Earth, as noted in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-hybrid" />) the force always has this value.  Rather than continuing to say <q>the force of gravity</q> we call this force the weight<idx>Weight</idx>.</p>

                <assemblage><p>The weight of an object is computed as its mass times the acceleration due to gravity, even when the object is not actually accelerating at that rate:  <m>\mathbf{F_g \equiv mg}</m>.</p></assemblage>

                </introduction>

                <subsection xml:id="ss-weightmass"><title>Weight versus Mass</title>
                <aside><title>Referenced by</title>
                        <p>
                        <xref ref="ss-convertunits" text="type-hybrid" />,

                <idx>Weight</idx>

                <p xml:id="p-defpound">Since all objects have the same acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth, the weight of an object and the mass of an object are very closely correlated, but they are not the same quantity.  This tends to cause some confusion when the discussion is not explicitly technical.  Recall the discussion about being precise in our language, <xref ref="s-precision" text="type-global" />.  One complication for people in the United States is that there are two definitions of the pound; one is a unit of mass<fn xml:id="fn-pound">There are also multiple versions of the pound-mass.  You can find these explained on the internet, but most of these are considered obsolete.  The one I will use is the <q>avoirdupois-pound</q>, which is defined in the NIST publication
                <!-- found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass) -->
                <url href="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/04/28/AppC-12-hb44-final.pdf">Handbook 44</url>, page C-19, as exactly <m>453.592 37\unit{g}</m>.</fn>
                and the other is a unit of force.  Since the pound-force<fn xml:id="fn-kg-pound">There is also a unit of force called the kilogram-force.</fn>
                <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(force) -->
                is defined as the standard unit of mass times the standard unit for the acceleration due to gravity, as discussed in <xref ref="s-SI-MKS" text="type-hybrid" />, the conversion directly from pound-force to Newtons will <em>not</em> match the longer, but more appropriate, conversion from pound-mass to kilogram that gets multiplied by the local acceleration due to gravity (as opposed to the standard <m>g</m>) into Newtons.  It may also be useful to review the comments about unit-conversion in the section on <xref ref="s-sigfig" text="title">significant digits</xref><idx>Significant Digits</idx>.</p>
                <todo>Update <xref ref="s-SI-MKS" text="type-hybrid" /> with this information.</todo>

                <p xml:id="p-weightmass">In the discussion about <xref ref="p-massive" text="title">being precise</xref>, we distinguished <q>massive</q> (the amount) from <q>voluminous</q> (the size).  Now that we understand <xref ref="as-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref>, we can distinguish <q>massive</q>
                (an amount of material causing a difficulty in making accelerate)
                from <q>weighty</q> (a strength needed to lift).
                The concept that goes with
                <assemblage><p>mass is the amount of material,</p></assemblage>
                whereas, the concept that goes with
                <assemblage><p>weight is how strongly the gravitational force pulls on the object.</p></assemblage>
                Having mass affects both the inertia (ease of moving) and the weight (force of gravity).
                Having weight expresses the gravitational force due to whichever large object (moon, planet, sun, etc.) you happen to be on or near.  Noticing that the SI-unit (<xref ref="s-SI-MKS" text="type-global" />) is different for different types of quantities, such as a kilogram (a <xref ref="p-fundamental" text="title">fundamental unit</xref>) for mass and a Newton (a <xref ref="p-derived" text="title">derived unit</xref>) for weight, may help you remember that these are different kinds of quantities.</p>

                <p>The interesting aspect of this relationship is that while having more mass makes an object harder to move (the same force produces less acceleration for more massive objects), when objects fall under the influence of the gravitational force, they accelerate at the <em>same</em> rate.  This reveals that the gravitational force must be stronger for more massive objects <em>by the exact amount</em> needed to compensate for that larger mass.  This is called the equivalence principle and is discussed in <xref ref="ss-equivmm" text="type-hybrid" />.</p>


                </subsection>

                <subsection xml:id="ss-local-mg"><title>Calculating the weight</title>

                <p>When calculating the forces acting on a person or an object, we will often need to account for the force of gravity, while other forces may also be at work.  As mentioned above, the weight is found by multiplying the mass times the local acceleration due to gravity, even if the object is not actually accelerating at that rate.  <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global" /> will clarify why it is true<fn xml:id="fn-accgrav-nuance">The short answer is that the altitude (distance from the surface of the Earth) and local geology affect the strength of the gravitational field.  Since the Earth is slightly oblate (bulges at the equator), the altitude at different latitudes corresponds to a different distance from the center of the Earth.  In addition, while the spin of the Earth does not affect the strength of the gravitational field, it does affect how objects accelerate. The <url href="http://www2.csr.utexas.edu/grace/gallery/animations/ggm01/ggm01_gif-200.html">GRACE project</url> has measured the variations across the globe.</fn>, but for now please note that the acceleration due to gravity is (1) different according to where we are and also (2) the same for all objects at that location.<idx><h>Acceleration</h><h>Gravity</h></idx><idx><h>Gravity</h><h>Acceleration</h></idx>
                </p>

                <p xml:id="d-weightmass">Because of the peculiarities in the <xref ref="p-defpound" text="title">definition of pound</xref> it will be useful to build some intuition about masses in terms of kilograms and Newtons.  <xref ref="t-weightmass" text="type-hybrid" /> lists the mass of some common objects and, using the standard value for <m>g</m>, their corresponding weights. <xref ref="c-weightmass" text="type-hybrid" /> asks you to estimate the mass of some other common objects.  <xref ref="c-massweight" text="type-hybrid" /> asks you to think of common objects with a specified mass.</p>

                        However, since we can see that \hisB\ acceleration is zero, the <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net}</m> <em>must be zero</em>.  The only way that can happen, though is if there is another force acting upwards on \studentB.  What could possibly be pushing up on \himB?  <xref ref="A-floor" text="type-local" />.  Whatever it is pushing up on \himB, it is supplying a support force, which can be calculated since
                                <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = \vec F_g + \vec F_\mathrm{support}</m>
                        and we can solve for

                        Because it is in the direction opposite to <m>\vec F_g</m>, it is upwards <m>(+\jhat)</m>.</p>

One useful way to think about it is that the floor is the thing keeping \himB\ from falling.  The direction of this force is <em>normal</em> (perpendicular) to the horizontal floor, so it is in the vertical direction.  This will be discussed in more detail in <xref ref="s-FN" text="type-global"/>.</answer>

                        <answer xml:id="A-second">You can tell that it is Newton's second law <m>(\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m \vec a)</m> because the forces we are considering are acting on the <em>same</em> object.  In this case, the gravitational force is caused by the Earth and the normal force is caused by the floor by they are both felt by \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>.  These forces happen to be equal and opposite because \heB\ happens to be in equilibrium. \HeB\ does not <em>have to be</em> in equilibrium, such as when \heB\ jumps, in which case the forces would not be equal and might not be opposite.</answer>

                        <answer xml:id="A-third"><p>If it were Newton's third law, then the two forces we were discussing would be acting on different objects and would be unrelated to the fact that the object (in this case, \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>) is in equilibrium.  The gravitational force and the normal force in this case are both acting on \studentB, so although they happen to be equal and opposite, this is not due to Newton's third law.</p>

                        <p>You should, however, note that the force that is reaction-paired to the gravitational force on \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> by the Earth is a gravitational force on the Earth by \studentB.  Similarly, the reaction-paired force to the normal force on \studentB\ by the floor is a normal force on the floor by \studentB.  (Please note the <q>on</q> and <q>by</q> in each case.)</p></answer>

                <p>As was mentioned earlier, the value of the acceleration due to gravity also varies across the surface, although this is less than about a percent or so (see <xref ref="t-gworld" text="type-hybrid"/>).

                This statement is making an approximation that allows us to compute values to a useful precision.

        <section xml:id="s-fundamental"><title>Fundamental Forces</title><idx><h>Force</h><h>Fundamental</h></idx>

        <p>The previous section describes our (macroscopic) experience of the gravitational interaction when standing on the surface of the Earth.  This is essentially the same across the surface, but does change with altitude and the difference can be measured on mountain tops and in caves.  In fact, one can use the differences from one location to another to predict where we might find a a pocket of oil.</p>

        <p xml:id="d-fundamental">In later sections, we will consider this and other interactions that depend on the physical properties, such as mass and charge.  All particles with the property of mass (which we will start to call gravitational charge) will interact according to the gravitational force; however, this description is better described by the mathematics in <xref ref="c-gravity" text="type-global"/>.  All particles with the property of electrical charge will interact according to the electrical force.  The basic theory will be discussed in <xref ref="c-electric" text="type-global"/>.  A more complicated version that incorporates quantum mechanics is called quantum electrodynamics (QED) and this will be touched on in <xref ref="ss-QED" text="type-global" />.  Particles like protons and neutrons (hadrons) are actually made up of other particles (quarks) that are held together by an interaction that is sometimes called the strong nuclear force (<xref ref="ss-strong" text="type-global" />) and is described by the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD); this will be touched on in <xref ref="ss-QCD" text="type-global" />.  Finally, in <xref ref="ss-weak" text="type-global"/> another fundamental force, called the weak nuclear force, will be discussed.</p>

        <p>For the most part, these theories describe the interaction between microscopic particles, so we will not discuss them in detail here.  However, the gravitational interaction is exception in a variety of ways.  In particular, the gravitational interaction does affect macroscopic objects.  These fundamental forces have a particular description that allows us to pretend (recall <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effective theories</xref>) that they are action-at-a-distance interactions.  All other forces (introduced next) will require physical contact in order to exert the force.</p>

                <p>The word <q>normal</q> <url href="http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=normal">originates</url><idx>Normal</idx> with the idea of conformity to the pattern.  While in everyday life this the typical state of being, the origins actually refer to a carpenter's square, which put corners into a right angle.  In math and physics, the word is used to mean perpendicular.  In the context of forces,
                <assemblage><p>the normal force is the force that a surface exerts to keep objects from passing through them.  The direction of this force is always in the outward direction, normal (perpendicular) to the surface.</p></assemblage>
                </p>

                <todo>DO we need to repeat the example here? no?</todo>
                <p>Let's consider some specific situations<ellipsis /> In <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />, \studentB\ felt the downwards gravitational force even while \heB\ was standing on the ground.  We noticed that \heB\ was not falling (and so not accelerating).  Colloquially, we say that the ground is supporting \studentB.  This support force is keeping \studentB\ from passing through the floor; this is a normal force.  The normal force from the floor is acting upwards, which is normal (perpendicular) to the surface of the floor.  <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" /> updates the free-body diagrams of <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> to show how the gravitational and normal forces impact that calculation.</p>

                <example xml:id="f-firstFBDupdate">
                        <title>People pushing a box also feel the gravitational and the normal forces</title>
                        <idx><h>Free-Body Diagrams</h><h>Images</h></idx>

                        <p>Let's start from a familiar example so that we focus our attention on the <em>new</em> aspect.  Starting from <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" />, we can observe that each of the three bodies also has a downwards gravitational force.  This is analogous to the calculation in <xref ref="se-weightA" text="type-global" />, which was only for \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx>; but you can calculate the weight for the mass in <xref ref="se-netF-a" text="type-global" /> and \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx>'s weight was computed in <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />.  In addition to the downward gravitational force (the weight), Newton's second law and the fact that nothing is accelerating up or down together tells us that there must also be a normal force on each body.  This is analogous to the calculation in <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />, which was only for \studentB; but you can deduce it for the object and for \studentA.</p>
                        <figure xml:id="f1-firstFBDupdate">
                                <caption><p>\studentA\ and \studentB\ push on a box</p></caption>

                        <p>Now, as in <xref ref="f2-firstFBD" text="type-global" />, we will draw a free-body diagram for each individual separately.  However, this time we will use the information calculated in <xref ref="se-weightA" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" /> to include the gravitational force (the weight) and the normal force.

                                <p>In order to find the force, we will first need to find the acceleration.
                                        <me> \vec a = \frac{\vec v_f-\vec v_i}{\Delta t} = \frac{(0\unitfrac ms)-(13.0\unitfrac ms \ihat)}{0.243\unit s} = -\sigfrac{53.4}{9}{m}{s^2}\ihat </me>
                                That the acceleration is in the direction opposite the velocity corresponds to the object slowing down.  Now we can find the <term>net force</term> from Newton's second law:

                                There are three forces acting on the car, as can be seen in analogy with the free-body diagrams of <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" />.  So, we can draw a free-body diagram here as well.</p>

                Some digital scales are inconvenient for understanding how they work because they don't display the value until it has come to something close to equilibrium.  If you have access to an analog scale, then you can watch the value change as it settles down and it might be easier to build your intuition.</p>

                <p>As you consider the values that you read on the scale, you should consider what happens if you jump off of or land upon a scale.  <em>Note that actually doing this can decalibrate your scale, if not break it entirely.  Scales are not meant to be handled this way.</em> While you are jumping from your scale, it must provide not only the force necessary to support your weight, but also the upwards force require to accelerate you upwards.  While you are landing on the scale, it musty provide not only the force necessary to support your weight, but also the upwards force necessary to decelerate you.</p>

                <p>Bathroom scales use leverage (i.e., <xref ref="s-leverarm" text="title">torque</xref>) and a <xref ref="s-springs" text="title">spring</xref>-system to balance the force pressing into them.

If you have ever installed a fan in your house, then you will notice that you have to support the fan while the wires are connected.  Usually the fan has a shaft that connects to the ceiling at one end and the fan at the other and provides a mechanism for supporting the fan while you manage the wires, which pass through the shaft.  Since the fan houses the motor, it is usually reasonably heavy.   The nice property of use a metal shaft to support the fan is that it doesn't stretch or wiggle like a chain might.  The difficulty in this example is that it is more difficulty to notice the tension in the shaft.

                <p>When considering the tension in the rope, the context is generally that the rope is connecting two objects that are trying to pull on each other.  It is convenient to recognize that each object only <q>sees</q> the rope, not the object at the far side.  This can be seen in a couple of contexts.</p>

                <todo>maybe add links about the tension chaning in the rope</todo>
                <p>We will start with the <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">simplistic approximation</xref> of ropes that only transmit the force.  As your understanding improves, we will add some examples where the tension in the rope also affects the rope itself.  In that more complicated situation, the tension will change across the rope and the rope may stretch.  Since ropes and cables are twisted strands while chains are links, ropes and cables can also introduce a <xref ref="s-torsion" text="title">torsion</xref> that tends not to occur in chains.

                        <introduction>
                        <p>Ropes and chains (and beams) can use tension to support (from above) dangling objects.</p>

                        <example xml:id="se-purse">
                                <title>Tension supports hanging objects</title>
                                <statement>
                                        <p>\studentD<idx><h sortby="\studentD">\studentD</h></idx> hangs \hisD\ purse <m>(m=1.36\unit{kg})</m> on a hook.  How much tension is in the shoulder strap to keep it from falling?</p>
                                </statement>
                                <solution>
                                        <p>The strap connects the hook to the purse.  We can consider the interaction between the hook and the strap or between the purse and the strap.  We will consider the latter since we don't know anything about the hook.  Considering the forces on the purse, we know that there is a downwards gravitational force of <m>\deq F_g = (1.36\unit{kg})(9.81\unitfrac{m}{s^2}) = \sig{13.3}{4}{N}</m> and that the net force must zero (because the purse is not accelerating). So, the strap must provide an upwards (tension) force.
                                        <md>
                                        <mrow> \vec F_T + \vec F_g \amp = m \cancelto{0}{\vec a} </mrow>
                                        <mrow>\vec F_T + (-\sig{13.3}{4}{N} \jhat) \amp = 0\unit N </mrow>
                                        <mrow>\vec F_T \amp = +\sig{13.3}{4}{N} \jhat </mrow>
                                        </md>
                                        This is the upwards force that the strap applies to the purse; however, the tension strap is doing two jobs: It is pulling up on the purse (as indicated above) <em>and</em> it is pulling down on the hook.</p>
                                </solution>
                        </example>

                        <p>The important thing to take away from <xref ref="se-purse" text="type-global" /> is not that we can compute the value (although that is, of course, a useful skill), but rather that
                        <assemblage><p>the tension is conveying the force between the two objects.</p></assemblage>
                        In the same way that the <xref ref="s-FN" text="title">normal force</xref> on a scale does not measure your weight, but rather the amount you press into the scale, the tension passes force on to the attached object.  The hook doesn't feel the weight of the purse, but does feel the tension required to support the purse.</p>

                        <p>In <xref ref="sss-multiple-mass" text="title">an upcoming section</xref>, we will consider what happens when multiple masses are hung from the rope.</p>

                        <p>You can probably think of several examples of objects dangling: a purse on a hook, a flag on a pole, a shop sign attached to a post, a pendulum,a swing set, etc.  Since these are all similar in some ways (although different in other ways), <em>we can treat all of them as a mass at the end of a rope</em>.  Typically, because we do not want to deal with the complications that come from sagging supports, we will use the <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">approximation</xref> of an <q><em>immovable support</em>.</q>  This will be indicated by hashing the surface.</p>

                <subsection xml:id="ss-tension-drag"><title>Tension as Dragging Force</title>

                <p xml:id="d-rope-net">We can also consider the tension in a rope used to drag an object across the floor.  You may recall that in <xref ref="f-firstFBD" text="type-global" /> (and the updated version, <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" />) \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> pulled a box across a sheet of ice.  It is possible that  \studentB\ was grabbing the object itself, but it is more likely that \heB\ was pulling on a rope that was attached to the object.  In that case, the tension in the rope was <m>4.0 \unit N</m>.  This tension is what pulled \studentB\ leftwards <em>and</em> what pulled the object rightwards.</p>

                <p>We can further update this by considering the case where \studentB\ pulls the rope up at an angle.  In that case, some of the tension is used to drag the box and some is used to reduce the normal force.  In <xref ref="f-firstFBDangle" text="type-global" />, we will have \studentA\ continue to push with <m>5.0\unit{N}</m> horizontally and have \studentB\ pull with <m>4.0\unit{N}</m> at a <m>14^\circ</m> angle above the horizontal.  You should note that since the tension on the object is pulling up, helping the normal force, this allows the normal force (what a scale would read) to be a little smaller. You should also note that since the tension on \studentB\ is pulling down, counter-acting the normal force, this requires the normal force (what a scale would read) to be a little larger.</p>

                        <p>Again, we can start by drawing a picture of the situation.  The description is the same as it was for <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="title" /> except that \studentB\ pulls at a slight angle upwards.  We will again need the gravitational force for \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> (<xref ref="se-weightA" text="type-global" />) and \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> (<xref ref="se-FNB" text="type-global" />).  As before, since nothing is accelerating up or down together, there must also be a normal force on each body.</p>

                        <p>Now, as in <xref ref="f-firstFBDupdate" text="type-global" />, we will draw a free-body diagram for each individual separately.  However, this time we will put the tension of the rope at the appropriate angle.  We will need to do a small calculation to find the value of the normal forces.</p>

                <subsection><title>Pulleys</title>

                <p>While the flexibility of ropes makes them inconvenient for pushing, their flexibility makes them <em>very useful</em> for changing the direction of the pull.  The mechanism for changing the direction is the pulley.  Furthermore, by allowing us to change the direction of the pull, we are also able to double, triple, or further improve the strength of the pull.  The term for this is <q>the mechanical advantage</q> of a pulley-system.</p>

                <p>First we will consider three simple cases of redirecting the force.  In each of these cases, I will <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">assume</xref> that the pulley and rope have no mass and that there is no friction in the turning of the pulley (assume it is trivially easy to spin).  If we do not make this assumption, then the problem gets significantly more complicated.</p><todo>add a reference to the section (problem?) where this is considered.</todo>

                                <p>Since the mass is in equilibrium, the net force is zero and the tension must balance the weight.  This tells us that the tension in the rope is <m>20 \unit N</m>.</p>

                                <p>If the pulley were difficult to turn (had friction) that stickiness could help support the mass and the tension on \studentA's side might be less than <m>20\unit N</m>; but since we assumed the pulley to be frictionless, \studentA\ must provide the full <m>20\unit N</m> of tension to the rope.</p>
                        </solution>
                </example>

                <p>The interesting aspect is that \studentA\ must pull <em>down</em> in order to produce the <em>upward</em> tension on the box.  This means that both \studentA\ and the mass are pulling down.  Since the rope is draped over the pulley, the pulley feels <m>40\unit N</m> downwards, <m>20\unit N</m> from the tension supporting the mass and <m>20\unit N</m> from \studentA\ who is creating the tension that supports the mass.  This means that the second rope that is connecting the pulley to the ceiling must be supporting the full <m>40\unit N</m> in order to keep the pulley in equilibrium.</p>

                        <p>The answer to this depends on how complicated you want the answer to be (recall the discussion about effective theories in <xref ref="s-effective2" text="type-global" />).  Some reasonable answers are:
                        <ul>
                        <li><p> If the rope (and the attachments) are static, then the net force on the rope must be zero even while it maintains the tension.  It is also possible that the rope is accelerating, in which case the net force on the rope while it transfers the forces between the objects at each end is whatever is necessary to produce the acceleration <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m_\mathrm{rope} \vec a_\mathrm{rope}</m>.</p></li>
                        <li><p> A different answer is to assume that the mass of the rope is small enough that whether it is in equilibrium or accelerating, it does not require a net force and it merely passes its tension through to the object at the other end.</p></li>
                        </ul>

        <section xml:id="s-FA"><title>Applied Force</title>

        <p>The term <q>an applied force</q> is used to describe any force applied by any object when there isn't really a formula to find it.  So this is kind of a <q>any other force</q> category.  I will use this type of force to describe forces exerted by people.  We have seen some examples where a person throws an object.  We can now revisit those examples and consider the force exerted (applied) by the person who threw the object.</p>

Recall that <xref ref="se-ceiling" text="type-global" /> found the normal force by the ceiling on the ball.  Please now find the force \studentC\ applied while throwing and catching the ball assuming that the throw took <m>0.200\unit{s}</m> to gain the speed of <m>5.00\unitfrac ms</m> and the catch took <m>0.250\unit s</m> to slow the ball from <m>4.73\unitfrac ms</m> to rest.</p>

                        <p>During each step, we have the actual acceleration, which tells us about the net force.  We will also need to know the weight of the baseball <m>F_g=\sig{1.42}{2}{N}</m>, because gravity is still acting during the collision.  Let's consider the throwing part first.

                        You can see that the upward applied force <m>(\sig{5.04}{7}{N})</m> has to be large enough so that when it is combined with the downward gravitational force <m>(\sig{1.42}{2}{N})</m> they can together result in the necessary (but smaller) upward net force <m>(\sig{3.62}{5}{N})</m> to get it going upwards.</p>

                        <p>For the catching part, the ball is moving downwards and needs to be stopped, so the catching applied force must be upwards.

                <p>The value of the acceleration due to gravity  varies according to the mass and size of any celestial body.

                <introduction>
                <p>The bright, shiny sun, which keeps us all alive, is a nice example of a rather complex system that allows us to verify our various theories of the world around us.  We can consider the existence of a star in three phases: the birth of a star, the life of the star, and the death of the star.</p>

<chapter><title>Characters</title>

        <introduction>
        <p>This textbook has five characters who follow you throughout the book.  They appear in the examples and some homework problems.  They also remember previous experiences.  I need to adjust the examples in <xref ref="c-force" text="type-hybrid" /> such that the people pushing boxes are helping the reader rearrange furniture.</p>

        <p>The index lists the pages that the characters appear.  The point of this chapter is to highlight some of the primary adventures of the characters according to their own perspectives.  <em>None of the links in this chapter will be given a corresponding return link.</em>  This chapter is for me to track relationships and will likely go away when the book is ready for publication</p>
        <todo>The index will recognize the people in two different formats.  One is by my name for them, which is <backslash />studentX (where X is A, B, C, D, <ellipsis /> Z).  The other is by the name assigned to that variable.  So these show up in different places in the Index.</todo>

        <p>I can, at the header of the code, define the name, gender, mass, and dimensions of each individual.</p>
        <todo><url href="http://malveyauthor.com/">Madeline Alvey</url>, the author of

The index-call that is <em>inside</em> of the section title registers as \studentA, which puts the name alphabetically under \studentA, rather than <backslash />studentA.</todo>

        <section><title>Stolen from sample-article</title>
                        <p>An ampersand is used, in two ways, to describe positioning several equations per line, organized in columns.  We suggest in <xref provisional="subsection-reserved-characters" text="type-global" /> that the pre-defined <latex /> macro <c>\amp</c> is the safest way to specify these.  The second, fourth, sixth, <ellipsis /> ampersands separate columns, and the spacing between columns will be provided automatically.  The first, third, fifth, <ellipsis /> ampersands are alignment points for the equations in each column.  Typically this is placed just prior to a binary operator, such as an equal sign (<c>\amp = </c>), or for a column of explanations or commentary, just prior to the <c>\text{}</c> macro.  Note that this scenario suggests always having an odd number of amersands in each <c>mrow</c>.  In the example below, alignment is on the equals sign in the first two columns, and provides left-justification to the explanations in the third column.  N.B.: the use below of the <c>\text{}</c> macro does not include mathematics within its argument.  Doing so may yield unpredictable results depending on your choice of delimiters for the mathematics (and using an <c>m</c> tag will be ineffective).<md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \amp \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y          \amp\amp x, y\text{ version}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} \amp = z^3 - w          \amp \frac{dz}{dt} \amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \amp\amp z, w\text{ version}</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p><pretext /> will automatically detect the presence or absence of ampersands, but by defining macros for entire aligned equations, you can effectively hide the ampersands.  So the <c>@alignment</c> attribute can override automatic detection.  We use a simple <latex /> macro to demonstrate setting <c>alignment='align'</c> to override the use of a <c>gather</c> environment and use a <c>align</c> environment instead.  (example deleted, has macro)</p>

                <p>The AMSmath <latex /> package's <c>alignat</c> environment is a third variant of alignment.  It never happens automatically, you need to ask for it with <c>alignment="alignat"</c>.  It is very similar to <c>align</c> but adds no space between the equation columns.  So you can leave it that way, or you can add your own <q>extra</q> space to suit.  Here is a previous example with no inter-column space:<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \amp \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y          \amp\amp x, y\text{ version}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} \amp = z^3 - w          \amp \frac{dz}{dt} \amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \amp\amp z, w\text{ version}</mrow>
                </md>.  This modified example has a middle row with three columns, while the other rows have just one column, as a test of our routines for determining the <c>mrow</c> with the greatest number of ampersands (and how many there are),<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} &amp;= z^3 - w</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= x^2 - 4x - y + 4 &amp; \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= x^3 - y&amp;&amp; x, y\text{ third column}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} &amp; = z^3 - w</mrow>
                </md>.  Final example demonstrates that ampersands in other objects (matrices here) can wreak havoc with computing the number of columns.  So we provide yet another attribute to override automatic detection, <c>alignat-columns</c>.  This is the number of <em>columns</em> not the number of <em>ampersands</em>.  Generally, for <m>c</m> columns, there will be <m>2c-1</m> ampersands.<md alignment="alignat" alignat-columns="2">
                    <mrow>A &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}
                    &amp;
                    I &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                </md>.  One caveat: if your number of ampersands is even (see advice above about using an odd number) behavior should still be correct, as in next example.</p>

                <p>If you want super-precise control over alignment of the terms of a system of equations (linear or not) you can use the <c>alignat</c> option to advantage by not including any extra space.  This example is modified slightly from a post by Alex Jordan:<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>2x \amp {}+{} \amp  y \amp {}+{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp 10</mrow>
                    <mrow>x  \amp       \amp    \amp {}+{} \amp  z \amp {}={} \amp 6</mrow>
                    <mrow>x  \amp {}+{} \amp 3y \amp {}+{} \amp 2z \amp {}={} \amp 13.</mrow>
                </md>Beautiful.</p>
