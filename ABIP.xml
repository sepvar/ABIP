        <introduction>
        <p>This text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in introductory algebra-based physics. </p>

        <p>The purpose of creating this book is to make better use of the technology that electronic texts allow for without losing the
        functionality of a print book.  While this text should be comparable to any other print text, when this is provided in the online
        format it will provide links back and forth between early and later topics.  Linking from later material to earlier material will
        allow students to refresh their memory of what was previously discussed.  Linking from earlier material to later material will
        inspire students to look ahead to how that topic will be used in more interesting scenarios. </p>

        <p>Having these links will allow for some other interesting features that can be placed in the back of the book and accessed
        through links.  Examples of this might be:
        <ol>
            <li><p> <q>Dig Deeper</q> where some of the more tedious and some of the more interesting aspects can be investigated. For
            example in <xref ref="c-motion"  /> on the equations of motion, one might see how these equations are direct applications of calculus
            for those students who happen to have taken that course (which is common for biology and pre-medical students). </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Every Equation Tells a Story</q> which discusses how the description-in-English and the description-with-math
            interrelate to build intuition in both directions. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Examples</q>, with the difference from a traditional textbook being that students can interact with the example as:
            <q>If you have this question, then go here. If you have that question, then go there.</q> </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>In the <lsq/>Real World<rsq/></q> where students see how the concept lives in the messy real world and why
            physicists simplify or ignore complicating aspects. </p></li>

            <li><p> <q>Connections</q>, which might take one of three forms:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p> <q>Where have I seen this before?</q> (linking back to earlier material) </p></li>

                <li><p> <q>When will I ever use this?</q> (linking ahead to later material) </p></li>

                <li><p> <q>Why is this interesting?</q> (linking to popular or complex topics)</p></li>
            </ol></li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>The goal of the book is to encourage curiosity in the reader. Since there is an expectation that students will explore the
        material on their own, advanced topics will explicitly note where the reader can look for supporting material and basic topics will
        be motivated with links to more advanced topics.  To help maintain the interest of the reader, recurring characters will be
        featured in the examples.  These characters will live a storyline<todo>storyboard the characters and how they develop</todo> and
        interact with each other.  It is possible to read the examples as a separate storyline for the N<todo>Decide how many
        characters</todo> interacting characters. </p>

        <p>I am choosing the approach described above based on the assumption that students will prefer to develop their knowledge by
        building a world-view that connects to their current understanding, their interests, and their world-view. Providing the
        cross-referencing links without distracting students with all of the information at once will enable them to explore the
        information. Writing the text in a narrative style that helps students see the explanations for the world they live in will
        encourage them to explore <q>what happens when I do this</q> in their real life. Fostering this spirit of exploration will enable
        the instructors to bring their own active-learning techniques into the classroom. </p>

        <p>This textbook is in several Parts<todo><em>Book Layout:</em> Here we should add information about Adventures, Examples,
        Equation-Stories, and IRLs.</todo>:  <em><xref ref="P-prerequisites"  text="type-global" /></em> is for the preliminaries, including descriptions of science in general, physics in
        particular, and the use of math.  <em><xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> is intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar.  <em><xref ref="P-UsingMFE"  text="type-global" /></em> develops the
        ideas in <xref ref="P-IntroMFE"  text="type-global" /> by introducing momentum, circular motion, rotational motion, torque, and the Newtonian theory of gravitation.
        <em><xref ref="P-oscillations">Parts</xref> and <xref ref="P-thermodynamics" text="global"/></em>  are oscillations and thermodynamics.  With the traditional organization of the two-semester
        introductory physics, these parts can be covered in either order and can be chosen to be put in either semester. <em><xref ref="P-EandM"  text="type-global" /></em>
        covers electricity, magnetism, light, and optics.  This is traditionally the meat of the second semester. <em><xref ref="P-modern"  text="type-global" /></em>
        touches on the topics that are usually referred to as <q>modern physics</q>.  The goal with including these chapters is to provide
        some inspiration for what some students see as the tedium of the standard material.  These chapters will be linked to throughout
        the book as examples of how the traditional material supports the material that may be in the news and is more talked about in
        popular science.  The last final part, <em><xref ref="P-supplements"  text="type-global" /></em>, holds the answers to the interactive examples mentioned above, the bulk
        of the adventures the reader can investigate in order to test their understanding of the material, and the story lines of each of
        the characters in the text. </p>

            <p>If you are viewing this as a PDF set to view <q>single page,</q> then the links will take you to the top of the relevant
            page, rather than to the specific topic.  If, on the other hand, you are viewing this in <q>continuous view</q> then you should
            go directly to the location of interest. If you are viewing this in <q>two-page</q> mode (whether continuous or not), it might
            not be immediately obvious to which page (left or right) you have jumped.  Most of the PDF viewers I have encountered allow you
            to follow links and to return to your previous location.  On most PCs, the way to return to your previous location is by
            holding the <c>ctrl</c> key and pressing the <m>[\leftarrow]</m> (<c>Left-Arrow</c>) button.  There are a few PDF viewers that do not
            allow you to <q>go back</q> to the location you linked from.  Whether or not you have that capability, I have placed <q>return
            links</q> in the margins so that you can get back to the place from which you linked. </p>

<chapter><title>The Story of Science</title>

        <introduction>
        <p>Once upon a time somebody saw the world around them and thought something equivalent to <q>well, that's an interesting pattern<ellipsis /></q> and predictions were born.  Every human and many animals build their own world of expectations such as: objects will fall down, food will arrive at mealtime, or certain people will smile at me.  Scientists study the patterns in the world around us and do so in a fairly specific way.  Novelists, sociologists, historians, and cartoonists also look at the world around us in a very particular way.  The story of humanity is a story about observing the world around us.</p>

        <p>Scientists, in general, observe patterns through careful, detailed measurements <ellipsis /></p>
        <todo>Add description of science.</todo>

        <p>Physicists, in particular, consider the patterns in the physical world around us.</p>
        <todo>Add description of physics</todo>

        <p xml:id="d-physicspatterns">Some patterns that you might experience help us take very different experiences and group them together.  For example, there are ways in which <xref ref="d-freefall">dropping your keys</xref> and <xref ref="d-ballistic">throwing a dog toy</xref> are very similar.  They both fall, even thought the fall along rather different paths.  There are also patterns that you experience that might look very similar but can be treated very differently.  For example, the path of baseball pitch (See <xref ref="irl-nonparabolic"  text="type-global" />.) is very different for a fast ball compared to a slider, a curve ball, or a knuckleball.</p>

        <!-- \new{v2.1}{Filled in the details a little.} -->
        <todo>This chapter should mirror <xref provisional="c-revisted"  text="type-global" /></todo>

        <introduction>
        <p>What you will find in this book is a series of chapters that, on the surface, feel like a list of isolated topics.  Each chapter will have examples that focus your attention on examples of that specific concept.  However, the really interesting aspect of physics is that these descriptions of the world around us come together in different ways to explain complex systems that might feel unrelated.  For example, the thermodynamics of making your refrigerator work on Earth comes from the same theories of thermodynamics that help us understand the heat flow of the sun.  Furthermore, in order to understand the sun, we also need to understand the gravitational interaction, which also describes how baseballs fly through the air.</p>

        <p>This chapter will introduce a set of quick-overview explanations of phenomena to indicate how different ideas tie together in some complex systems.  The point  is specifically to over-simplify complex ideas in order to <q>get the idea</q>.  You will also be pointed to the various chapters that go into the details of the relevant physics where you can learn more.  Then, at the end of the book in <xref provisional="c-revisted"  text="type-global" />, we will revisit each of these ideas and go into the description in more depth assuming you have understood each of the relevant chapters, with reference back to the sections that provide the basis of our understanding.</p>

                <warning> <p>Since this particular chapter is intended to be background introduction, rather than a place to study details, none of the links to other sections here will have return links in the rest of the text.  So, if you intend to use this as a jumping off point, you might want to create a bookmark here so that you can return after you read the details in other sections.</p></warning>

                <p>The point of this section is to whet your whistle, to provide an appetizer before the main meal, to inspire your curiosity.

Since that is the inspiration, we will start by referencing it explicitly.  After that you will find some brief explanations for complex ideas.</p>

                <p>In the early ages of the universe, which is an entirely different story that could be told, there were a ridiculously large number of particles created and drifting around.  There were a variety of types (<xref provisional="ss-StandardModel"  text="type-global" />), some being positively charged (<xref provisional="s-Echarge"  text="type-global" />), some negatively charged, and some were neutral; but the larger ones tended to gradually decay (<xref provisional="ss-particledecay"  text="type-global" />) into smaller ones.  The smaller of the positively-charged baryons (<xref provisional="s-particle"  text="type-global" />), which we call protons, and the smallest of the negatively-charged leptons (<xref provisional="s-particle"  text="type-global" />), which we call electrons, also tended to stick together because of their electrical charges (<xref provisional="s-Echarge"  text="type-global" />), forming hydrogen atoms.  You may note that as this happens, sometimes the more ambitious of the particles form larger clumps of two protons and two neutrons, making helium atoms that are held together by the strong nuclear force ([need ref])</p>

                        <p>The bright, shiny sun, which keeps us all alive, is a nice example of a rather complex system that allows us to verify our various theories of the world around us.

        <todo>Should this be here or in <xref ref="s-effective2"  text="type-global" />?</todo>

        <p>All of our explanations are approximations.  This section will describe some physics in the world around us in one or two paragraphs with links to the sections in the book that provide the detailed understanding of that piece which connects to the mathematics and the underlying foundation.  Each topic will also link to a more detailed discussion at the end of the book with a longer conversation that gets into more nitty-gritty details which assume you have learned the details from the book.  In short, this section looks forward to what is possible to understand and that chapter looks back at how you do understand.  Each of these topics will also be accompanied by a five-minute podcast describing the topic.</p>

        <p>The term <q>effective theory</q> is used in physics to describe a wide-reaching phenomenon which can be approximated by a simpler theory in a smaller circumstance.  So, for example, Einstein's theory of general relativity as a complex description of the gravitational interaction.  It would be unwieldy and impractical to use that to describe our day-to-day interactions with the gravitational interaction.  On the other hand, Newton's theory of the gravitational interaction is a special case of Einstein's general theory of relativity that works perfectly well so long as you behave yourself and do not try to travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light.  We can say that Newton's theory of gravity is an effective theory for Einstein's theory of gravity that accounts for acceleration at low speeds.  Likewise, Einstein's special theory of relativity is an effective theory of the general theory of relativity.  The special theory is relevant when you do not allow for acceleration, but do allow for faster speeds.  Once you reach beyond the limitations of the effective theory, the description <q>breaks down</q>.</p>

<chapter><title>Why so much math?</title>

        <introduction>
        <p>Mathematics is its own language.  It is the language of patterns.  Humans are very adept at tracking patterns.  Physics is the study of patterns in the physical world.  It turns out that the language of physics provides a natural and concise mechanism for expressing patterns in a uniquely precise manner.</p>
        </introduction>

        <section xml:id="s-story"><title>Every equation tells a story</title>

        <p>Equations allow us to connect physical reality to very specific predictions.  For example, the equation for thermal conductivity, <xref provisional="eq-thermalconductivity"  text="type-global" /> in <xref provisional="ss-thermalconductivity"  text="type-global" />, allows \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> to predict the time it takes for \hisA\ oven to warm up to a specific temperature because <m>\displaystyle \frac{Q}{\Delta t} = \kappa A \, \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}</m> says that {the rate at which energy flows} {depends on} {how well air allows energy to flow,} {the size of the oven,} and {the amount the temperature needs to change} {across the height of the oven} as follows:</p>

                <p>The International System of Units (SI) <xref ref="biblio-wiki-SI" /> was adopted in 1960 at the

                of the

                                <li><p> The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram;</p></li>

                                <li><p> The value adopted in the International Service of Weights and Measures for the standard acceleration due to gravity is <m>980.665 \unitfrac{cm}{s^2}</m>, value already stated in the laws of some countries.</p></li>

                Other related decisions were made at the following meetings:

                                <li><p> The 11th meeting (1960) redefined the meter in terms of wavelengths of light.</p></li>

                                <li><p> The 17th meeting (1983) redefined the meter in terms of the speed of light and seconds.</p></li>
                                <li><p> The 24th (2011) and 25th (2014) meeting discussed redefining the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant, with an expectation that it will be redefined at the 26th meeting (Nov, 2018).  See note in <xref ref="ss-units"  text="type-global" />.</p></li>

        <section xml:id="s-precision"><title>Precision and Accuracy</title>
        <idx>Precision</idx>
        <!-- \new{v2.2}{Added section, added some detail} -->

        <p>In this section, we will consider the benefits of being precise both in measurements and in our language.  Sometimes people confuse the words precise and accurate, but they mean different things.  It may help to remember that the opposite of precise is vague.  Being precise makes it easier to determine if a statement is accurate.  If we already know the answer, then we can know if a result is accurate.  However, the exciting aspect of science is to study that which we do not already know.  In this case, gauging accuracy can be tricky.  If we are do not already know an answer, then we can try to be consistent within our accepted precision.</p>

        <p>Since physics has its roots in the natural philosophy of the ancient Greeks and developed mathematically with Galileo and Newton, it has been around long enough for the technical language to both evolve (Newton used the word <q>action</q> for what we refer to as <q>force</q>) and to be absorbed into everyday (colloquial) language. Words like force and energy have taken on broader meanings in English.  In this text, we will try to be precise with the language.  Hopefully we can avoid using the dismissive phrase, <q>Oh, you <em>know</em> what I <em>mean</em>.</q></p>

        <p>One example of not being careful with the language comes when people use the term <q>massive</q> to mean <q>big.</q>  The word massive actually means <q>has a large amount of material</q> whereas big means <q>takes up a large amount of space</q> (which might be replaced by the word <q>voluminous</q> rather than <q>massive</q>). These are related by <xref provisional="s-density">the density</xref><idx>Density</idx> but it is possible to be massive and not voluminous (see, for example, the discussion of <xref provisional="s-blakhole2">black holes</xref>).  While it is <em></em>technically} inaccurate to use massive to mean big, <q>we</q> know what <q>we</q> mean.</p>

        <p>Life is complicated.  One mechanism that scientists in general and physicists in particular use to simplify their descriptions of the world around us is to build an effective theory.  These are not intended to be true (accurate) to as many decimal places as can be calculated, but rather are intended to be good enough.  In this context, good enough is most likely to mean something like: true to a reasonable number of decimal places.</p>

        <p>A colloquial example of this is when you wear a smile to give the impression of happiness even if you are not in the mood.  Most of your casual interactions will be the same as when you are in a good mood, but your friends who know you better will recognize the small discrepancies.</p>

        <p>A technical example of this is that Newton's theory of gravity is very precise as long as none of the objects being described are travelling <q>close</q> to the speed of light.  How close counts as close depends on the level of precision the measurement needs to be.  If any of the objects are moving close to the speed of light, then we need Einstein's general theory of relativity.  One way to describe this is that Newton's theory is a special case of Einstein's Theory.  Another way is describe it is that Newton's theory is an effective theory for Einstein's theory, effective when the speed is low.  It is possible for us to measure the difference between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory, but it is often not worth the effort of using the more complex theory in the cases where the simpler one will do; it is effectively true (rather than actually true).</p>

        <p>Another technical example is that Einstein's special theory of relativity is a special case of the general theory of relativity.  The aspect that makes it a special case is that the special theory only considers motion without acceleration.</p>

        <p>One final case that should be mentioned up front is to notice that humans experience the Earth <em>as if</em> it were stationary.

<part xml:id="P-IntroMFE"><title>Introducing Motion, Force, and Energy</title>
        <introduction>
        <p>The chapters in this Part are intended to introduce three fundamental and powerful concepts.  These
        concepts are motion, force, and energy.  I have found that if a student can understand these ideas sufficiently well, then they can
        quickly pick up any other idea that we introduce, even if the idea seems initially unfamiliar. </p>

        <p>The trio of topics in this part of the book are fundamental and powerful concepts<fn xml:id="f-FPC">The idea of Fundamental and Powerful Concepts (F&amp;PC) is taken from Dr. Gerald Nosich, <em>Learning to Think Things Through</em>, Prentice Hall, 2012.</fn>.  These are fundamental in that most other topics in physics are built upon them.  They are powerful in that if they are well-understood, then one is empowered to use them to understand and develop an intuition for nearly any other topic that is experienced.  It has been my experience that with these topics, students can jump into a surprisingly wide variety of other, significantly more esoteric, topics and develop a reasonable grasp of the key concepts.  Furthermore, the development of understanding of these ideas introduce the language and thought processes of being a professional physicist such that it nicely bridges the language barrier that might otherwise exist due to the jargon of physics.</p>

                <p xml:id="d-freefall">Since acceleration is the change in velocity (magnitude and/or direction), it is possible to select your own rate of change while driving your car.  However, that acceleration is difficult to measure directly.  Your speedometer measures the speed and you have to compute your acceleration based on how quickly your speed changes.  It turns out that there is a convenient way to start from the acceleration and compute the expected velocity:  Drop a ball or your keys.  To convince yourself that objects do, in fact, accelerate when they fall, we can consider dropping items.  One of the complications during such an experiment will be discussed in <xref ref="ss-airresistance" text="type-global" />.  If we drop a sheet of paper, air resistance causes an obvious effect (fluttering).  For this section, I will assume that the mass-to-surface-area ratio is large enough that we can <xref ref="s-effective2" text="title">effectively</xref> ignore the air resistance.</p>

If you have something somewhat cylindrical, like a wine bottle (!) or a pencil that is falling more quickly than something else, like a hammer, then try dropping the cylindrical object in different orientations to see if that affects the air resistance.

                We will start to discuss the reason for this in <xref provisional="s-Fg" text="type-global" /> and then get into more detail in <xref provisional="c-gravity" text="type-global" />.

                                                <li><p>there are five stages to the motion of the baseball: the throw (<xref ref="ex-ceiling-h1" text="type-global" />), the ball moving from \studentC's hand up to but not yet hitting the ceiling (<xref ref="ex-ceiling-h2" text="type-global" />), the ball hitting the ceiling (<xref ref="ex-ceiling-h3" text="type-global" />), the ball falling from the ceiling down to but not yet touching \studentC's hand (<xref ref="ex-ceiling-h4" text="type-global" />), and the catching of the ball (<xref ref="ex-ceiling-h5" text="type-global" />), and</p></li>
                                                <li><p><xref ref="d-EOM">the equations of constant acceleration</xref> assume that the acceleration is constant (<xref ref="ex-ceiling-h6" text="type-global" />).</p></li>

                                        The acceleration is <m>\deq a = \frac{v_f-v_i}{\Delta t}</m>, but the story of this equation says that since the acceleration is only during the interaction with the ceiling, then the velocities in this equation are just-before the ball hits and just-after the ball hits (not the very beginning velocity and not the very final velocity).  Similarly, the <m>\Delta t</m> in this equation is only the time during which it was interacting with the ceiling, not the entire flight.</p>

                                        <p>Now that we have the velocities immediately before (from <xref ref="ex-ceiling-h2" text="type-global" />) and after (from <xref ref="ex-ceiling-h4" text="type-global" />) the collision with the ceiling, we can find the acceleration:
                                                <m> a = \frac{v_f-v_i}{\Delta t}
                                                        = \frac{(-\sigfrac{4.73}{4}{m}{s})-(+\sigfrac{2.31}{9}{m}{s})}{(0.142\unit s)}
                                                        = -\sigfrac{28.0}{9}{m}{s^2} \,\jhat </m>
                                        Notice that the acceleration is negative because the ball went from going up to going down.</p>

It turns out that the air resistance is fairly complicated, but in the case of baseballs, the part that is relevant is that air resistance is strong when the ball is moving faster and weak when the ball is moving slower.  (This is different than the surface friction you will see in <xref provisional="s-Ff" text="type-global"/>.)  The effect of this is that the ball (usually) looks like it travels up into the air on a fairly straight path with a slight bend, which would produce a very wide parabola.  As it slows, the horizontal motion decreases, which tightens the parabola.  By the time the ball gets to its highest point, it is often travelling fairly slowly and has mostly all vertical motion by the time it drops into the outfielder's glove.</p></solution>

As the ball rolls out of the pitcher's hand, a spin is (usually) given to the ball and this spin interacts with the air to modify the direction that the air presses on the ball during the flight.  This will slightly affect the flight of the ball during the time it takes for the ball to get from the pitcher's mound to home plate.  In addition, fast balls have less time for the gravitational force to pull the ball down, so they will curve downwards less than a slower pitch.  This makes following the path of the ball somewhat difficult, but with some practice and careful attention, you should be able to see it.  All balls will drop somewhat, but the effect of the air resistance is exactly the mechanism for making a pitch unpredictable, so it is unlikely that you see the ball drop in a clean parabolic path.</p></solution>

        <p>Sometimes we care about the thing doing the pushing or pulling, sometimes we don't.  We always care about the thing being pushed or pulled.  We will <em>distinguish these objects</em> by referring to the object that is pushing as the object <q>causing the force</q> or <q>exerting the force</q> and by referring to the object that is being pushed as the object <q>feeling the force</q>.  We will <em>distinguish these forces</em> as follows:
                <convention>
                <p>Let's imagine that \studentB<idx><h sortby="\studentB">\studentB</h></idx> gives \studentA<idx><h sortby="\studentA">\studentA</h></idx> a good-natured shove in the arm.  The following are useful descriptions and are different ways of describing the same action.

                        If it is not obvious which object feels the force, the the subscript will also indicate which object the force is acted <em>on</em>.
                        Sometimes we need to clarify who exerts the force as well as who feels the force.  In this case, the subscripts indicate who the force is <em>on</em>, who the force is <em>by</em>, and which force we are referring to: <m>F_\mathrm{on, by, type}</m>.
                        </description>
                </notation>
                The notation for this will be <m>F_{A,B}</m> where the first subscript is the person who felt the force (who the force is <q>on</q>) and the second subscript is who exerted the force (who the force is <q>by</q>).  In those instances when we only care about who is feeling the force and not who is exerting the force, we might just use one subscript <m>F_A</m>.  In some cases, there may be two forces acting on one person (or object).  In that case, it will be obvious who is feeling the force and we will use the subscript to distinguish which force it is, such as <m>F_1</m> or <m>F_2</m>, rather than who feels the force.</p>
                </convention>
        This will be more relevant when we discuss in <xref provisional="c-forcetype" text="type-global"/> the types of forces that might be applied.</p>

        </ol>
        The answer to these questions have a precise, concise, technical language and the point of the next three subsections are to translate that into (modern) English, into math, and into intuition.  The statement of these laws has slightly different versions in different texts to emphasize different points.  We will state them as follows<idx><h>Newton</h><h>Laws</h></idx><idx><h>Laws</h><h>Newton</h></idx>:
        <ol xml:id="sum-NewtonsLaws">
                <li><p>When viewed from an inertial reference frame, an object with no forces acting on it will maintain its velocity, which may be zero.</p></li>
                <li><p> When viewed from an inertial reference frame, the vector-sum of all forces acting on an object will cause that object to accelerate in proportion to its mass: <m>\vec F_\mathrm{net} = m \vec a</m>.</p></li>
                <li><p> For every force acting (the <q>action</q>) on one object by an other object, there is an equal-in-magnitude reaction-force acting on the other object in the opposite direction.</p></li>
        </ol></p>

        <p xml:id="d-NewtonInertial">There are a few terms that should be clarified in these laws.  Being in an inertial <xref ref="d-referenceframe" text="title">reference frame</xref><idx><h>Reference Frames</h><h>Inertial</h></idx> essentially means being in a place in which you do not have to hold on in order to maintain your position.  If you are <xref ref="s-acceleration" text="title">accelerating</xref> (recall<todo>Make this <q>recall</q> a pop-up, not a parenthetical, by linking to paragraph, not a section</todo> that this means <em>speeding up</em>, <em>slowing down</em>, or <em>changing direction</em>) then you are not in an inertial reference frame, but rather are in a non-inertial reference frame.  In this case, you will misinterpret the forces acting.  This will be discussed in more detail in <xref provisional="s-noninertial" text="type-global" /> when we discuss centripetal force and in <xref provisional="ss-coriolis" text="type-global" /> when we discuss the Coriolis effect.</p>

        <p xml:id="d-objectinmotion">Sometimes Newton's first law is written to include the phrase <q>an object in motion</q>, which I will be careful to link directly to <xref ref="d-motion" text="title">velocity</xref>, as was done above.  However, it technically should reference the momentum, which is discussed in <xref provisional="c-momentum" text="type-global" />.</p>

        <p>The way Newton's third law is often written and referred to includes the words <q>action</q> and <q>reaction</q>.  Newton was referring to forces with these words and to keep it clear in our discussion, we will use the word force, with the occasional clarification of the action-force or the reaction-force.</p>

                <p>Let's take this apart and connect it to your daily experiences.  Looking ahead, we will discuss the surface of the Earth as a <xref provisional="d-noninertial">non-inertial rotating reference frame</xref>; however, the effect is small enough that for most of what we <xref ref="d-casual">casually observe</xref>, we can safely pretend that the Earth is stationary and that we are actually at rest while sitting on the curb watching the world go by.  This is so true that our human brains already interpret everything around us as though it were an inertial reference frame.  This psychological perspective is exactly the feature that both allows us to make fairly reliable predictions about the world around us <em>and</em> causes us to make incorrect judgements when we encounter non-inertial reference frames.  That is to say, as long as we don't measure our world too closely, we are viewing it from an essentially inertial reference frame.  This point is so implicit, that many books do not even include
                        <todo>Consider adding comment about Newton not including <q>inertial reference frame</q> to his laws.</todo>

                <p xml:id="d-atrestinmotion">The rest of this statement is often written a little differently (and less concisely) as <q>an object at rest remains at rest unless acted on by an external force and an object in motion remains in motion unless acted on by an external force.</q>  Since being <xref ref="d-atrest"><q>at rest</q></xref> is a statement about the velocity<m>(\vec v=0)</m> and being <xref ref="d-motion"><q>in motion</q></xref> is also a statement about the velocity, each of these statements can be understood as saying that
                <assemblage><p>Forces are those things that cause a change in the velocity.</p></assemblage>
                In other words, Newton's first law says that without a force, the velocity will not change.  In the discussion of <xref provisional="sss-equilibrium" text="title">equilibrium</xref>, we will note that this is often extended to say that without a <xref provisional="sss-netforce" text="title">net force</xref> the velocity will not change, but that is a special case of <xref provisional="ss-NII" text="title">Newton's second law</xref>.</p>

                        <subsubsection xml:id="sss-inertia"><title>Inertia</title><idx>Inertia</idx>

                        This law is often called the <q>law of inertia</q>.  The concept of inertia can be described as <em>the tendency of an object to maintain its velocity</em>.  This is describing how the object behaves when you don't do anything to it.  The inertia is not a quantity that physicists calculate, but physicists do refer to objects as having a lot of inertia, usually to indicate that it will take a large force to change the object's motion, or as having a small amount of inertia, usually to indicate that it should be relatively easy to change the object's motion.  However, the inertia does not actually refer to the force needed.  Instead, the inertia most often refers to the <q>inertial mass</q> of an object, which shows up in the second law.
                                <assemblage><p>Inertia is not a force.</p></assemblage>
                        Sometimes when physicists are not being careful with their language, they will appear to use the word inertia interchangeably with the term <xref provisional="c-momentum" text="title">momentum</xref>, which we will discuss in more detail in <xref provisional="ss-inertia" text="type-global" />}.

                        <p>You should notice that Newton's First Law is about what happens when you are <em>not pushing</em> on the object, which is to say, the tendency of an object to maintain its own motion without a force acting on it; this is the inertia of the object.  On the other hand, Newton's Second Law is about what happens <em>to the object</em> when you <em>do push</em> on an it.  This is what we will consider next.  After that, Newton's third law will describe what happens <em>to the thing pushing</em> rather than just to the thing being pushed.
