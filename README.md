# ABIP

In this directory, I have a file ABIP.tex which is written in LaTeX.  This is the original version of the book.
There are a lot of latex .sty files included to try some fancy stuff.

I am also going to create an ABIP.xml for accessing the MathbookXML format.
I will need to translate ABIP.tex into xml 
That file will need a new name...  Maybe I will call that the "Connected Physics" that I took as the temporary title.
